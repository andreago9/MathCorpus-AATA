        "content": "Preface\nThis text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in abstract algebra.\nTraditionally, these courses have covered the theoretical aspects of groups, rings, and fields.\nHowever, with the development of computing in the last several decades, applications that\ninvolve abstract algebra and discrete mathematics have become increasingly important,\nand many science, engineering, and computer science students are now electing to minor in\nmathematics. Though theory still occupies a central role in the subject of abstract algebra\nandnostudentshouldgothroughsuchacoursewithoutagoodnotionofwhataproofis,the\nimportance of applications such as coding theory and cryptography has grown significantly.\nUntil recently most abstract algebra texts included few if any applications. However,\noneofthemajorproblemsinteachinganabstractalgebracourseisthatformanystudentsit\nis their first encounter with an environment that requires them to do rigorous proofs. Such\nstudents often find it hard to see the use of learning to prove theorems and propositions;\napplied examples help the instructor provide motivation.\nThis text contains more material than can possibly be covered in a single semester.\nCertainly there is adequate material for a two-semester course, and perhaps more; however,\nfor a one-semester course it would be quite easy to omit selected chapters and still have a\nuseful text. The order of presentation of topics is standard: groups, then rings, and finally\nfields. Emphasis can be placed either on theory or on applications. A typical one-semester\ncourse might cover groups and rings while briefly touching on field theory, using Chapters 1\nthrough 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 (the first part), 16, 17, 18 (the first part), 20, and 21. Parts of\nthese chapters could be deleted and applications substituted according to the interests of\nthe students and the instructor. A two-semester course emphasizing theory might cover\nChapters 1 through 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 through 18, 20, 21, 22 (the first part), and 23. On\nthe other hand, if applications are to be emphasized, the course might cover Chapters 1\nthrough 14, and 16 through 22. In an applied course, some of the more theoretical results\ncould be assumed or omitted. A chapter dependency chart appears below. (A broken line\nindicates a partial dependency.)\nv"

A basic knowledge of set theory, mathematical induction, equivalence\nrelations,andmatricesisamust. Evenmoreimportantistheabilitytoreadandunderstand\nmathematical proofs. In this chapter we will outline the background needed for a course in\nabstract algebra.\n1.1 A Short Note on Proofs\nAbstract mathematics is different from other sciences. In laboratory sciences such as chem-\nistry and physics, scientists perform experiments to discover new principles and verify theo-\nries. Although mathematics is often motivated by physical experimentation or by computer\nsimulations, it is made rigorous through the use of logical arguments. In studying abstract\nmathematics, we take what is called an axiomatic approach; that is, we take a collection\nof objects S and assume some rules about their structure. These rules are called axioms.\nUsing the axioms for S, we wish to derive other information about S by using logical argu-\nments. We require that our axioms be consistent; that is, they should not contradict one\nanother. We also demand that there not be too many axioms. If a system of axioms is too\nrestrictive, there will be few examples of the mathematical structure.\nA statement in logic or mathematics is an assertion that is either true or false. Consider\nthe following examples:\n• 3+56(cid:0)13+8/2.\n• All cats are black.\n• 2+3 = 5.\n• 2x = 6 exactly when x = 4.\n• If ax2+bx+c = 0 and a 6= 0, then\np\n(cid:0)b(cid:6) b2(cid:0)4ac\nx = .\n2a\n• x3(cid:0)4x2+5x(cid:0)6.\nAll but the first and last examples are statements, and must be either true or false.\nA mathematical proof is nothing more than a convincing argument about the accuracy\nofastatement.

        "content": "CHAPTER 1. PRELIMINARIES 2\ninstance, we can see that the statement “2x = 6 exactly when x = 4” is false by evaluating\n2(cid:1)4 and noting that 6 6= 8, an argument that would satisfy anyone. Of course, audiences\nmay vary widely: proofs can be addressed to another student, to a professor, or to the\nreader of a text. If more detail than needed is presented in the proof, then the explanation\nwill be either long-winded or poorly written. If too much detail is omitted, then the proof\nmay not be convincing. Again it is important to keep the audience in mind. High school\nstudents require much more detail than do graduate students. A good rule of thumb for an\nargumentinanintroductoryabstractalgebracourseisthatitshouldbewrittentoconvince\none’s peers, whether those peers be other students or other readers of the text.\nLetusexaminedifferenttypesofstatements. Astatementcouldbeassimpleas“10/5 =\n2;” however, mathematicians are usually interested in more complex statements such as “If\np, then q,” where p and q are both statements. If certain statements are known or assumed\nto be true, we wish to know what we can say about other statements. Here p is called\nthe hypothesis and q is known as the conclusion. Consider the following statement: If\nax2+bx+c = 0 and a 6= 0, then\np\n(cid:0)b(cid:6) b2(cid:0)4ac\nx = .\n2a\nThe hypothesis is ax2+bx+c = 0 and a 6= 0; the conclusion is\np\n(cid:0)b(cid:6) b2(cid:0)4ac\nx = .\n2a\nNotice that the statement says nothing about whether or not the hypothesis is true. How-\never, if this entire statement is true and we can show that ax2 +bx+c = 0 with a 6= 0 is\ntrue, then the conclusion must be true. A proof of this statement might simply be a series\nof equations:\nax2+bx+c = 0\nb c\nx2+ x = (cid:0)\na a\n(cid:18) (cid:19) (cid:18) (cid:19)\nb b 2 b 2 c\nx2+ x+ = (cid:0)\na 2a 2a a\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\nb 2 b2(cid:0)4ac\nx+ =\n2a 4a2\np\nb (cid:6) b2(cid:0)4ac\nx+ =\n2a 2pa\n(cid:0)b(cid:6) b2(cid:0)4ac\nx = .\n2a\nIf we can prove a statement true, then that statement is called a proposition. A propo-\nsition of major importance is called a theorem. Sometimes instead of proving a theorem\nor proposition all at once, we break the proof down into modules; that is, we prove several\nsupporting propositions, which are called lemmas, and use the results of these propositions\nto prove the main result. If we can prove a proposition or a theorem, we will often, with\nvery little effort, be able to derive other related propositions called corollaries.\nSome Cautions and Suggestions\nThere are several different strategies for proving propositions. In addition to using different\nmethods of proof, students often make some common mistakes when they are first learning"

To aid students who are studying abstract mathematics for the\nfirst time, we list here some of the diﬀiculties that they may encounter and some of the\nstrategies of proof available to them. It is a good idea to keep referring back to this list as\na reminder. (Other techniques of proof will become apparent throughout this chapter and\nthe remainder of the text.)\n• A theorem cannot be proved by example; however, the standard way to show that a\nstatement is not a theorem is to provide a counterexample.\n• Quantifiers are important. Words and phrases such as only, for all, for every, and for\nsome possess different meanings.\n• Never assume any hypothesis that is not explicitly stated in the theorem. You cannot\ntake things for granted.\n• Suppose you wish to show that an object exists and is unique. First show that there\nactually is such an object. To show that it is unique, assume that there are two such\nobjects, say r and s, and then show that r = s.\n• Sometimes it is easier to prove the contrapositive of a statement. Proving the state-\nment “If p, then q” is exactly the same as proving the statement “If not q, then not\np.”\n• Although it is usually better to find a direct proof of a theorem, this task can some-\ntimes be diﬀicult. It may be easier to assume that the theorem that you are trying\nto prove is false, and to hope that in the course of your argument you are forced to\nmake some statement that cannot possibly be true.\nRemember that one of the main objectives of higher mathematics is proving theorems.\nTheoremsaretoolsthatmakenewandproductiveapplicationsofmathematicspossible. We\nuse examples to give insight into existing theorems and to foster intuitions as to what new\ntheorems might be true. Applications, examples, and proofs are tightly interconnected—\nmuch more so than they may seem at first appearance.\n1.2 Sets and Equivalence Relations\nSet Theory\nA set is a well-defined collection of objects; that is, it is defined in such a manner that we\ncan determine for any given object x whether or not x belongs to the set. The objects that\nbelong to a set are called its elements or members. We will denote sets by capital letters,\nsuch as A or X; if a is an element of the set A, we write a 2 A.\nA set is usually specified either by listing all of its elements inside a pair of braces or\nby stating the property that determines whether or not an object x belongs to the set. We\nmight write\nX = fx ,x ,...,x g\n1 2 n\nfor a set containing elements x ,x ,...,x or\n1 2 n\nX = fx : x satisfies Pg\nif each x in X satisfies a certain property P. For example, if E is the set of even positive\nintegers, we can describe E by writing either\nE = f2,4,6,...g or E = fx : x is an even integer and x > 0g."

A set\nA is a subset of B, written A (cid:26) B or B (cid:27) A, if every element of A is also an element of B.\nFor example,\nf4,5,8g (cid:26) f2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9g\nand\nN (cid:26) Z (cid:26) Q (cid:26) R (cid:26) C.\nTrivially, every set is a subset of itself. A set B is a proper subset of a set A if B (cid:26) A but\nB 6= A. If A is not a subset of B, we write A 6(cid:26) B; for example, f4,7,9g 6(cid:26) f2,4,5,8,9g.\nTwo sets are equal, written A = B, if we can show that A (cid:26) B and B (cid:26) A.\nIt is convenient to have a set with no elements in it. This set is called the empty set\nand is denoted by ;. Note that the empty set is a subset of every set.\nTo construct new sets out of old sets, we can perform certain operations: the union\nA[B of two sets A and B is defined as\nA[B = fx : x 2 A or x 2 Bg;\nthe intersection of A and B is defined by\nA\\B = fx : x 2 A and x 2 Bg.\nIf A = f1,3,5g and B = f1,2,3,9g, then\nA[B = f1,2,3,5,9g and A\\B = f1,3g.\nWe can consider the union and the intersection of more than two sets. In this case we write\n[n\nA = A [...[A\ni 1 n\ni=1\nand\n\\n\nA = A \\...\\A\ni 1 n\ni=1\nfor the union and intersection, respectively, of the sets A ,...,A .\n1 n\nWhen two sets have no elements in common, they are said to be disjoint; for example,\nif E is the set of even integers and O is the set of odd integers, then E and O are disjoint.\nTwo sets A and B are disjoint exactly when A\\B = ;.\nSometimes we will work within one fixed set U, called the universal set. For any set\nA (cid:26) U, we define the complement of A, denoted by A′ , to be the set\nA′ = fx : x 2 U and x 2/ Ag.\nWe define the difference of two sets A and B to be\nAnB = A\\B′ = fx : x 2 A and x 2/ Bg."

For example, the set R3 consists of all of 3-tuples of real numbers.\nSubsets of A(cid:2)B are called relations. We will define a mapping or function f (cid:26) A(cid:2)B\nfrom a set A to a set B to be the special type of relation where each element a 2 A has\na unique element b 2 B such that (a,b) 2 f. Another way of saying this is that for every\nelement in A, f assigns a unique element in B. We usually write f : A ! B or A !f B.\nInstead of writing down ordered pairs (a,b) 2 A(cid:2)B, we write f(a) = b or f : a 7! b. The\nset A is called the domain of f and\nf(A) = ff(a) : a 2 Ag (cid:26) B\nis called the range or image of f.

For example, the function f : R ! R that sends each real number\nto its cube is a mapping that must be described by writing f(x) = x3 or f : x 7! x3.\nConsider the relation f : Q ! Z given by f(p/q) = p. We know that 1/2 = 2/4, but\nis f(1/2) = 1 or 2? This relation cannot be a mapping because it is not well-defined.

An equivalence relation on a set X is a\nrelation R (cid:26) X (cid:2)X such that\n• (x,x) 2 R for all x 2 X (reflexive property);\n• (x,y) 2 R implies (y,x) 2 R (symmetric property);\n• (x,y) and (y,z) 2 R imply (x,z) 2 R (transitive property).\nGiven an equivalence relation R on a set X, we usually write x (cid:24) y instead of (x,y) 2 R.\n(cid:24)\nIf the equivalence relation already has an associated notation such as =, (cid:17), or =, we will\nuse that notation.\nExample 1.21 Let p, q, r, and s be integers, where q and s are nonzero. Define p/q (cid:24) r/s\nif ps = qr. Clearly (cid:24) is reflexive and symmetric. To show that it is also transitive, suppose\nthat p/q (cid:24) r/s and r/s (cid:24) t/u, with q, s, and u all nonzero. Then ps = qr and ru = st.\nTherefore,\npsu = qru = qst.\nSince s 6= 0, pu = qt.

Let (cid:24) be an equivalence relation on a set X and let x 2 X. Then\nk k\n[x] = fy 2 X : y (cid:24) xg is called the equivalence class of x. We will see that an equivalence\nrelation gives rise to a partition via equivalence classes. Also, whenever a partition of a\nset exists, there is some natural underlying equivalence relation, as the following theorem\ndemonstrates.\nTheorem 1.25 Given an equivalence relation (cid:24) on a set X, the equivalence classes of X\nform a partition of X. Conversely, if P = fX g is a partition of a set X, then there is an\ni\nequivalence relation on X with equivalence classes X .\ni\nProof. Suppose there exists an equivalence relation (cid:24) on the set X. For any x 2 X, the\nS\nreflexive property shows that x 2 [x] and so [x] is nonempty. Clearly X = [x]. Now\nx∈X\nlet x,y 2 X. We need to show that either [x] = [y] or [x] \\ [y] = ;. Suppose that the\nintersection of [x] and [y] is not empty and that z 2 [x]\\[y]. Then z (cid:24) x and z (cid:24) y. By\nsymmetry and transitivity x (cid:24) y; hence, [x] (cid:26) [y]. Similarly, [y] (cid:26) [x] and so [x] = [y].\nTherefore, any two equivalence classes are either disjoint or exactly the same.\nConversely, suppose that P = fX g is a partition of a set X. Let two elements be\ni\nequivalent if they are in the same partition. Clearly, the relation is reflexive. If x is in the\nsame partition as y, then y is in the same partition as x, so x (cid:24) y implies y (cid:24) x. Finally, if\nx is in the same partition as y and y is in the same partition as z, then x must be in the\nsame partition as z, and transitivity holds. ■\nCorollary 1.26 Two equivalence classes of an equivalence relation are either disjoint or\nequal.\nLet us examine some of the partitions given by the equivalence classes in the last set of\nexamples."

PRELIMINARIES 13\nExample 1.27 In the equivalence relation in Example 1.21, two pairs of integers, (p,q) and\n(r,s), are in the same equivalence class when they reduce to the same fraction in its lowest\nterms. □\nExample 1.28 In the equivalence relation in Example 1.22, two functions f(x) and g(x)\nare in the same partition when they differ by a constant. □\nExample 1.29 We defined an equivalence class on R2 by (x ,y ) (cid:24) (x ,y ) if x2 +y2 =\n1 1 2 2 1 1\nx2 +y2. Two pairs of real numbers are in the same partition when they lie on the same\n2 2\ncircle about the origin. □\nExample 1.30 Let r and s be two integers and suppose that n 2 N. We say that r is\ncongruent to s modulo n, or r is congruent to s mod n, if r(cid:0)s is evenly divisible by n; that\nis, r(cid:0)s = nk for some k 2 Z. In this case we write r (cid:17) s (mod n). For example, 41 (cid:17) 17\n(mod 8) since 41(cid:0)17 = 24 is divisible by 8. We claim that congruence modulo n forms an\nequivalence relation of Z. Certainly any integer r is equivalent to itself since r (cid:0)r = 0 is\ndivisible by n. We will now show that the relation is symmetric. If r (cid:17) s (mod n), then\nr (cid:0) s = (cid:0)(s (cid:0) r) is divisible by n. So s (cid:0) r is divisible by n and s (cid:17) r (mod n). Now\nsuppose that r (cid:17) s (mod n) and s (cid:17) t (mod n). Then there exist integers k and l such\nthat r(cid:0)s = kn and s(cid:0)t = ln. To show transitivity, it is necessary to prove that r(cid:0)t is\ndivisible by n. However,\nr(cid:0)t = r(cid:0)s+s(cid:0)t = kn+ln = (k+l)n,\nand so r(cid:0)t is divisible by n.\nIf we consider the equivalence relation established by the integers modulo 3, then\n[0] = f...,(cid:0)3,0,3,6,...g,\n[1] = f...,(cid:0)2,1,4,7,...g,\n[2] = f...,(cid:0)1,2,5,8,...g.\nNotice that [0][[1][[2] = Z and also that the sets are disjoint. The sets [0], [1], and [2]\nform a partition of the integers.\nThe integers modulo n are a very important example in the study of abstract algebra\nand will become quite useful in our investigation of various algebraic structures such as\ngroups and rings. In our discussion of the integers modulo n we have actually assumed a\nresult known as the division algorithm, which will be stated and proved in Chapter 2. □\nSage.

Notice that the\nset Z is not well-ordered since it does not contain a smallest element. However, the natural\nnumbers are well-ordered.\nPrinciple 2.6 Principle of Well-Ordering. Every nonempty subset of the natural\nnumbers is well-ordered.\nThe Principle of Well-Ordering is equivalent to the Principle of Mathematical Induction.\nLemma 2.7 The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies that 1 is the least positive\nnatural number.\nProof. Let S = fn 2 N : n (cid:21) 1g. Then 1 2 S. Assume that n 2 S. Since 0 < 1, it must\nbe the case that n = n+0 < n+1. Therefore, 1 (cid:20) n < n+1. Consequently, if n 2 S,\nthen n+1 must also be in S, and by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, and we have\nS = N. ■\nTheorem 2.8 The Principle of Mathematical Induction implies the Principle of Well-\nOrdering. That is, every nonempty subset of N contains a least element.\nProof. We must show that if S is a nonempty subset of the natural numbers, then S\ncontains a least element. If S contains 1, then the theorem is true by Lemma 2.7. Assume\nthat if S contains an integer k such that 1 (cid:20) k (cid:20) n, then S contains a least element. We\nwill show that if a set S contains an integer less than or equal to n+1, then S has a least\nelement. If S does not contain an integer less than n+1, then n+1 is the smallest integer\nin S. Otherwise, since S is nonempty, S must contain an integer less than or equal to n. In\nthis case, by induction, S contains a least element. ■\nInduction can also be very useful in formulating definitions. For instance, there are two\nways to define n!, the factorial of a positive integer n.\n• The explicit definition: n! = 1(cid:1)2(cid:1)3(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(n(cid:0)1)(cid:1)n.\n• The inductive or recursive definition: 1! = 1 and n! = n(n(cid:0)1)! for n > 1.\nEverygoodmathematicianorcomputerscientistknowsthatlookingatproblemsrecursively,\nas opposed to explicitly, often results in better understanding of complex issues."

THE INTEGERS 20\n2.2 The Division Algorithm\nAn application of the Principle of Well-Ordering that we will use often is the division\nalgorithm.\nTheorem 2.9 Division Algorithm. Let a and b be integers, with b > 0. Then there\nexist unique integers q and r such that\na = bq+r\nwhere 0 (cid:20) r < b.\nProof. This is a perfect example of the existence-and-uniqueness type of proof. We must\n′ ′\nfirst prove that the numbers q and r actually exist. Then we must show that if q and r\n′ ′\nare two other such numbers, then q = q and r = r .\nExistence of q and r. Let\nS = fa(cid:0)bk : k 2 Z and a(cid:0)bk (cid:21) 0g.\nIf 0 2 S, then b divides a, and we can let q = a/b and r = 0. If 0 2/ S, we can use the\nWell-Ordering Principle. We must first show that S is nonempty. If a > 0, then a(cid:0)b(cid:1)0 2 S.\nIf a < 0, then a (cid:0) b(2a) = a(1 (cid:0) 2b) 2 S. In either case S 6= ;. By the Well-Ordering\nPrinciple, S must have a smallest member, say r = a(cid:0)bq. Therefore, a = bq +r, r (cid:21) 0.\nWe now show that r < b. Suppose that r > b. Then\na(cid:0)b(q+1) = a(cid:0)bq(cid:0)b = r(cid:0)b > 0.\nIn this case we would have a(cid:0)b(q+1) in the set S. But then a(cid:0)b(q+1) < a(cid:0)bq, which\nwould contradict the fact that r = a(cid:0)bq is the smallest member of S. So r (cid:20) b. Since\n0 2/ S, r 6= b and so r < b.\n′ ′\nUniqueness of q and r. Suppose there exist integers r, r , q, and q such that\na = bq+r,0 (cid:20) r < b and a = bq′ +r′ ,0 (cid:20) r′ < b.\nThenbq+r = bq′ +r′ . Assumethatr′ (cid:21) r. Fromthelastequationwehaveb(q(cid:0)q′ ) = r′(cid:0)r;\ntherefore, b must divide r′ (cid:0)r and 0 (cid:20) r′ (cid:0)r (cid:20) r′ < b. This is possible only if r′ (cid:0)r = 0.\nHence, r = r′ and q = q′ . ■\nLet a and b be integers. If b = ak for some integer k, we write a j b. An integer d\nis called a common divisor of a and b if d j a and d j b. The greatest common divisor of\n′\nintegers a and b is a positive integer d such that d is a common divisor of a and b and if d\nis any other common divisor of a and b, then d′ j d.

If d were another common divisor of 945 and 2415,\nthen d would also have to divide 105. Therefore, gcd(945,2415) = 105.\nIf we work backward through the above sequence of equations, we can also obtain num-\nbers r and s such that 945r+2415s = 105.

Two important results from antiq-\nuityareEuclid’sproofthataninfinitenumberofprimesexistandtheSieveofEratosthenes,\na method of computing all of the prime numbers less than a fixed positive integer n. One\nproblem in number theory is to find a function f such that f(n) is prime for each integer n.\nPierre Fermat (1601?–1665) conjectured that 22n +1 was prime for all n, but later it was\nshown by Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) that\n225\n+1 = 4,294,967,297\nis a composite number. One of the many unproven conjectures about prime numbers is\nGoldbach’s Conjecture. In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach stated the conjec-\nture that every even integer with the exception of 2 seemed to be the sum of two primes:\n4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 8 = 3 + 5, .... Although the conjecture has been verified for the\nnumbers up through 4(cid:2)1018, it has yet to be proven in general. Since prime numbers play\nan important role in public key cryptography, there is currently a great deal of interest in\ndetermining whether or not a large number is prime.\nSage.

Supposethateande arebothidentitiesinG. Theneg = ge = g andeg = ge = g\nfor all g 2 G. We need to show that e = e′ . If we think of e as the identity, then ee′ = e′ ;\n′ ′ ′ ′\nbut if e is the identity, then ee = e. Combining these two equations, we have e = ee = e.\n■\n′ ′′\nInverses in a group are also unique. If g and g are both inverses of an element g\n′ ′ ′′ ′′ ′ ′′\nin a group G, then gg = g g = e and gg = g g = e. We want to show that g = g ,\n′ ′ ′ ′′ ′ ′′ ′′ ′′\nbut g = g e = g (gg ) = (g g)g = eg = g . We summarize this fact in the following\nproposition.\nProposition 3.18 If g is any element in a group G, then the inverse of g, denoted by\ng−1,\nis unique.\nProposition 3.19 Let G be a group. If a,b 2 G, then (ab)−1 = b−1a−1.\nProof. Let a,b 2 G. Then abb−1a−1 = aea−1 = aa−1 = e. Similarly, b−1a−1ab = e. But\nby the previous proposition, inverses are unique; hence, (ab)−1 = b−1a−1. ■\nProposition 3.20 Let G be a group. For any a 2 G, (a−1)−1 = a.\nProof. Observe that\na−1(a−1)−1\n= e.

If a and b\nare two elements in a group G, does there exist an element x 2 G such that ax = b? If such\nan x does exist, is it unique?

Notice that (gh)n 6= gnhn in\ngeneral, since the group may not be abelian. If the group is Z or Z , we write the group\nn\noperation additively and the exponential operation multiplicatively; that is, we write ng\ninstead of gn.

Later, Évariste Galois (1811–1832) succeeded in devel-\nopingthemathematicsnecessarytodetermineexactlywhichpolynomialequationscouldbe\nsolved in terms of the coeﬀicients of the polynomial. Galois’ primary tool was group theory.\nThe study of geometry was revolutionized in 1872 when Felix Klein proposed that geo-\nmetric spaces should be studied by examining those properties that are invariant under\na transformation of the space. Sophus Lie, a contemporary of Klein, used group theory\nto study solutions of partial differential equations. One of the first modern treatments of\ngroup theory appeared in William Burnside’s The Theory of Groups of Finite Order [1],\nfirst published in 1897."

The set of\neven integers 2Z = f...,(cid:0)2,0,2,4,...g is a group under the operation of addition. This\nsmaller group sits naturally inside of the group of integers under addition. We define a\nsubgroup H of a group G to be a subset H of G such that when the group operation of\nG is restricted to H, H is a group in its own right. Observe that every group G with at\nleast two elements will always have at least two subgroups, the subgroup consisting of the\nidentity element alone and the entire group itself. The subgroup H = feg of a group G\nis called the trivial subgroup. A subgroup that is a proper subset of G is called a proper\nsubgroup. In many of the examples that we have investigated up to this point, there exist\nother subgroups besides the trivial and improper subgroups.\nExample 3.24 Consider the set of nonzero real numbers,\nR∗\n, with the group operation of\nmultiplication. The identity of this group is 1 and the inverse of any element a 2 R∗ is just\n1/a. We will show that\nQ∗ = fp/q : pandqare nonzero integersg\nis a subgroup of\nR∗\n.

Given two elements in\nQ∗\n, say p/q and r/s,\ntheir product pr/qs is also in Q∗ . The inverse of any element p/q 2 Q∗ is again in Q∗ since\n(p/q)−1\n= q/p.

In this chapter we will study the properties\nof cyclic groups and cyclic subgroups, which play a fundamental part in the classification\nof all abelian groups.\n4.1 Cyclic Subgroups\nOften a subgroup will depend entirely on a single element of the group; that is, knowing\nthat particular element will allow us to compute any other element in the subgroup.\nExample 4.1 Suppose that we consider 3 2 Z and look at all multiples (both positive and\nnegative) of 3. As a set, this is\n3Z = f...,(cid:0)3,0,3,6,...g.\nIt is easy to see that 3Z is a subgroup of the integers. This subgroup is completely deter-\nmined by the element 3 since we can obtain all of the other elements of the group by taking\nmultiples of 3. Every element in the subgroup is “generated” by 3. □\nExample 4.2 If H = f2n : n 2 Zg, then H is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of\nnonzero rational numbers, Q∗ . If a = 2m and b = 2n are in H, then ab−1 = 2m2−n = 2m−n\nis also in H. By Proposition 3.31, H is a subgroup of Q∗ determined by the element 2. □\nTheorem 4.3 Let G be a group and a be any element in G. Then the set\nhai = fak : k 2 Zg\nis a subgroup of G. Furthermore, hai is the smallest subgroup of G that contains a.\nProof. The identity is in hai since a0 = e. If g and h are any two elements in hai, then\nby the definition of hai we can write g = am and h = an for some integers m and n. So\ngh = aman = am+n is again in hai. Finally, if g = an in hai, then the inverse g−1 = a−n is\nalso in hai. Clearly, any subgroup H of G containing a must contain all the powers of a by\nclosure; hence, H contains hai. Therefore, hai is the smallest subgroup of G containing a.\n■\nRemark 4.4 If we are using the “+” notation, as in the case of the integers under addition,\nwe write hai = fna : n 2 Zg.\nFor a 2 G, we call hai the cyclic subgroup generated by a. If G contains some element\na such that G = hai, then G is a cyclic group. In this case a is a generator of G. If a is an\n46"

        "content": "CHAPTER 4. CYCLIC GROUPS 48\nSubgroups of Cyclic Groups\nWe can ask some interesting questions about cyclic subgroups of a group and subgroups of\na cyclic group. If G is a group, which subgroups of G are cyclic? If G is a cyclic group,\nwhat type of subgroups does G possess?\nTheorem 4.10 Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.\nProof. The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of\nWell-Ordering. Let G be a cyclic group generated by a and suppose that H is a subgroup\nof G. If H = feg, then trivially H is cyclic. Suppose that H contains some other element\ng distinct from the identity. Then g can be written as an for some integer n. Since H is a\nsubgroup, g−1 = a−n must also be in H. Since either n or (cid:0)n is positive, we can assume\nthat H contains positive powers of a and n > 0. Let m be the smallest natural number\nsuch that am 2 H. Such an m exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.\nWe claim that h = am is a generator for H. We must show that every h′ 2 H can be\nwritten as a power of h. Since h′ 2 H and H is a subgroup of G, h′ = ak for some integer\nk. Using the division algorithm, we can find numbers q and r such that k = mq+r where\n0 (cid:20) r < m; hence,\nak = amq+r = (am)qar = hqar.\nSo ar = akh−q. Since ak and h−q are in H, ar must also be in H. However, m was the\nsmallest positive number such that am was in H; consequently, r = 0 and so k = mq.\nTherefore,\nh′ = ak = amq = hq\nand H is generated by h. ■\nCorollary 4.11 The subgroups of Z are exactly nZ for n = 0,1,2,....\nProposition 4.12 Let G be a cyclic group of order n and suppose that a is a generator for\nG. Then ak = e if and only if n divides k.\nProof. First suppose that ak = e. By the division algorithm, k = nq+r where 0 (cid:20) r < n;\nhence,\ne = ak = anq+r = anqar = ear = ar.\nSince the smallest positive integer m such that am = e is n, r = 0.\nConversely, if n divides k, then k = ns for some integer s. Consequently,\nak = ans = (an)s = es = e.\n■\nTheorem 4.13 Let G be a cyclic group of order n and suppose that a 2 G is a generator\nof the group. If b = ak, then the order of b is n/d, where d = gcd(k,n).\nProof. We wish to find the smallest integer m such that e = bm = akm. By Proposi-\ntion 4.12, this is the smallest integer m such that n divides km or, equivalently, n/d divides\nm(k/d). Since d is the greatest common divisor of n and k, n/d and k/d are relatively\nprime. Hence, for n/d to divide m(k/d) it must divide m. The smallest such m is n/d. ■\nCorollary 4.14 The generators of Z are the integers r such that 1 (cid:20) r < n and gcd(r,n) =\nn\n1.\nExample 4.15 Let us examine the group Z . The numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15\n16\nare the elements of Z that are relatively prime to 16. Each of these elements generates\n16\nZ .

Then H is a subgroup of the circle group. Also, 1, (cid:0)1, i,\nand (cid:0)i are exactly those complex numbers that satisfy the equation z4 = 1. The complex\nnumbers satisfying the equation zn = 1 are called the nth roots of unity.\nTheorem 4.25 If zn = 1, then the nth roots of unity are\n(cid:18) (cid:19)\n2kπ\nz = cis ,\nn\nwhere k = 0,1,...,n(cid:0)1.

However, if we could compute something like\n237,398,332 (mod 46,389),\nwe could very easily write the result down since it would be a number between 0 and 46,388.\nIf we want to compute powers modulo n quickly and eﬀiciently, we will have to be clever.4\nThe first thing to notice is that any number a can be written as the sum of distinct\npowers of 2; that is, we can write\na = 2k1 +2k2 +(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+2kn,\nwhere k < k < (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) < k .

Notice that\n321 = 20+26+28;\nhence, computing 271321 (mod 481) is the same as computing\n27120+26+28 (cid:17) 27120 (cid:1)27126 (cid:1)27128 (mod 481).\nSo it will suﬀice to compute 2712i (mod 481) where i = 0,6,8. It is very easy to see that\n27121 = 73,441 (cid:17) 329 (mod 481).\nWe can square this result to obtain a value for 27122 (mod 481):\n27122 (cid:17) (27121 )2 (mod 481)\n(cid:17) (329)2 (mod 481)\n(cid:17) 108,241 (mod 481)\n(cid:17) 16 (mod 481).\nWe are using the fact that (a2n)2 (cid:17) a2·2n (cid:17) a2n+1 (mod n).

When using cycle notation, we often denote the identity permutation\nby (1).\nTranspositions\nThe simplest permutation is a cycle of length 2. Such cycles are called transpositions. Since\n(a 1,a 2,...,a n) = (a 1,a n)(a 1,a n−1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(a 1,a 3)(a 1,a 2),\nany cycle can be written as the product of transpositions, leading to the following proposi-\ntion.\nProposition 5.12 Any permutation of a finite set containing at least two elements can be\nwritten as the product of transpositions.\nExample 5.13 Consider the permutation\n(16)(253) = (16)(23)(25) = (16)(45)(23)(45)(25).\nAs we can see, there is no unique way to represent permutation as the product of transposi-\ntions. Forinstance,wecanwritetheidentitypermutationas(12)(12),as(13)(24)(13)(24),\nand in many other ways. However, as it turns out, no permutation can be written as the\nproduct of both an even number of transpositions and an odd number of transpositions.\nFor instance, we could represent the permutation (16) by\n(23)(16)(23)\nor by\n(35)(16)(13)(16)(13)(35)(56),\nbut (16) will always be the product of an odd number of transpositions. □\nLemma 5.14 If the identity is written as the product of r transpositions,\nid = τ τ (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)τ ,\n1 2 r\nthen r is an even number.\nProof. We will employ induction on r. A transposition cannot be the identity; hence,\nr > 1. If r = 2, then we are done. Suppose that r > 2. In this case the product of the last\ntwo transpositions, τ r−1τ r, must be one of the following cases:\n(a,b)(a,b) = id\n(b,c)(a,b) = (a,c)(b,c)\n(c,d)(a,b) = (a,b)(c,d)\n(a,c)(a,b) = (a,b)(b,c),\nwhere a, b, c, and d are distinct."

In this\nnew product the last occurrence of a will be in the next-to-the-last transposition.

He was the first to\nuse cycle notation. Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) was born in Paris at the height\nof the French Revolution. His family soon left Paris for the village of Arcueil to escape\nthe Reign of Terror. One of the family’s neighbors there was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–\n1827), who encouraged him to seek a career in mathematics. Cauchy began his career as\na mathematician by solving a problem in geometry given to him by Lagrange. Cauchy\nwrote over 800 papers on such diverse topics as differential equations, finite groups, applied\nmathematics, and complex analysis. He was one of the mathematicians responsible for\nmaking calculus rigorous. Perhaps more theorems and concepts in mathematics have the\nname Cauchy attached to them than that of any other mathematician.\n5.2 Dihedral Groups\nAnother special type of permutation group is the dihedral group. Recall the symmetry\ngroup of an equilateral triangle in Chapter 3. Such groups consist of the rigid motions of a\nregular n-sided polygon or n-gon. For n = 3,4,..., we define the nth dihedral group to be\nthe group of rigid motions of a regular n-gon. We will denote this group by D . We can\nn\nnumber the vertices of a regular n-gon by 1,2,...,n (Figure 5.19). Notice that there are\nexactly n choices to replace the first vertex. If we replace the first vertex by k, then the\nsecond vertex must be replaced either by vertex k+1 or by vertex k(cid:0)1; hence, there are 2n\npossible rigid motions of the n-gon. We summarize these results in the following theorem."

Let us consider the\ngroup of rigid motions of a cube. By rigid motion, we mean a rotation with the axis of\nrotation about opposing faces, edges, or vertices. One of the first questions that we can ask\nabout this group is “what is its order?” A cube has 6 sides. If a particular side is facing\nupward, then there are four possible rotations of the cube that will preserve the upward-\nfacing side. Hence, the order of the group is 6(cid:1)4 = 24. We have just proved the following\nproposition.\nProposition 5.26 The group of rigid motions of a cube contains 24 elements.\nTheorem 5.27 The group of rigid motions of a cube is S .\n4\nProof. From Proposition 5.26, we already know that the motion group of the cube has 24\nelements, the same number of elements as there are in S . There are exactly four diagonals\n4\nin the cube. If we label these diagonals 1, 2, 3, and 4, we must show that the motion group\nof the cube will give us any permutation of the diagonals (Figure 5.28). If we can obtain\nall of these permutations, then S and the group of rigid motions of the cube must be the\n4\n◦\nsame. To obtain a transposition we can rotate the cube 180 about the axis joining the\nmidpoints of opposite edges (Figure 5.29). There are six such axes, giving all transpositions\nin S . Since every element in S is the product of a finite number of transpositions, the\n4 4\nmotion group of a cube must be S .\n4"

The aim of cryptogra-\nphy is to send messages across a channel so that only the intended recipient of the message\ncan read it. In addition, when a message is received, the recipient usually requires some\nassurance that the message is authentic; that is, that it has not been sent by someone who\nis trying to deceive the recipient. Modern cryptography is heavily dependent on abstract\nalgebra and number theory.\nThe message to be sent is called the plaintext message. The disguised message is called\ntheciphertext. Theplaintextandtheciphertextarebothwritteninanalphabet, consisting\nof letters or characters. Characters can include not only the familiar alphabetic characters\nA, ..., Z and a, ..., z but also digits, punctuation marks, and blanks. A cryptosystem,\nor cipher, has two parts: encryption, the process of transforming a plaintext message to\na ciphertext message, and decryption, the reverse transformation of changing a ciphertext\nmessage into a plaintext message.\nThere are many different families of cryptosystems, each distinguished by a particular\nencryption algorithm. Cryptosystems in a specified cryptographic family are distinguished\nfrom one another by a parameter to the encryption function called a key. A classical\ncryptosystem has a single key, which must be kept secret, known only to the sender and\nthe receiver of the message. If person A wishes to send secret messages to two different\npeople B and C, and does not wish to have B understand C’s messages or vice versa, A\nmust use two separate keys, so one cryptosystem is used for exchanging messages with B,\nand another is used for exchanging messages with C.\nSystems that use two separate keys, one for encoding and another for decoding, are\ncalled public key cryptosystems. Since knowledge of the encoding key does not allow\nanyone to guess at the decoding key, the encoding key can be made public. A public key\ncryptosystem allows A and B to send messages to C using the same encoding key. Anyone\nis capable of encoding a message to be sent to C, but only C knows how to decode such a\nmessage.\n7.1 Private Key Cryptography\nIn single or private key cryptosystems the same key is used for both encrypting and de-\ncrypting messages. To encrypt a plaintext message, we apply to the message some function\nwhich is kept secret, say f. This function will yield an encrypted message. Given the en-\ncrypted form of the message, we can recover the original message by applying the inverse\ntransformationf−1.\nThetransformationf mustberelativelyeasytocompute,\nasmustf−1;\nhowever, f must be extremely diﬀicult to guess from available examples of coded messages.\n81"

Methods\nfrom probability and statistics are great aids in deciphering an intercepted message; for\nexample, the frequency analysis of the characters appearing in the intercepted message\noften makes its decryption possible.\nExample 7.2 Suppose we receive a message that we know was encrypted by using a shift\ntransformation on single letters of the 26-letter alphabet. To find out exactly what the shift\ntransformation was, we must compute b in the equation f(p) = p+b mod 26. We can do\nthis using frequency analysis. The letter E = 04 is the most commonly occurring letter\nin the English language. Suppose that S = 18 is the most commonly occurring letter in\nthe ciphertext. Then we have good reason to suspect that 18 = 4+b mod 26, or b = 14.\nTherefore, the most likely encrypting function is\nf(p) = p+14 mod 26.\nThe corresponding decrypting function is\nf−1(p)\n= p+12 mod 26.\nIt is now easy to determine whether or not our guess is correct. □\nSimple shift codes are examples of monoalphabetic cryptosystems.

The encoding function f must be relatively easy to compute,\nbut\nf−1\nmust be extremely diﬀicult to compute without some additional information, so\nthat someone who knows only the encrypting key cannot find the decrypting key without\nprohibitivecomputation. Itisinterestingtonotethattodate, nosystemhasbeenproposed\nthat has been proven to be “one-way;” that is, for any existing public key cryptosystem,\nit has never been shown to be computationally prohibitive to decode messages with only\nknowledge of the encoding key.\nThe RSA Cryptosystem\nThe rsa cryptosystem introduced by R. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman in 1978, is\nbased on the diﬀiculty of factoring large numbers. Though it is not a diﬀicult task to find\ntwo large random primes and multiply them together, factoring a 150-digit number that is\nthe product of two large primes would take 100 million computers operating at 10 million\ninstructions per second about 50 million years under the fastest algorithms available in the\nearly 1990s. Although the algorithms have improved, factoring a number that is a product\nof two large primes is still computationally prohibitive.\nThe rsa cryptosystem works as follows. Suppose that we choose two random 150-\ndigit prime numbers p and q. Next, we compute the product n = pq and also compute\nϕ(n) = m = (p(cid:0)1)(q(cid:0)1), where ϕ is the Euler ϕ-function. Now we start choosing random\nintegers E until we find one that is relatively prime to m; that is, we choose E such that\ngcd(E,m) = 1. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we can find a number D such that DE (cid:17) 1\n(mod m). The numbers n and E are now made public.\nSuppose now that person B (Bob) wishes to send person A (Alice) a message over a\npublic line. Since E and n are known to everyone, anyone can encode messages. Bob\nfirst digitizes the message according to some scheme, say A = 00,B = 02,...,Z = 25. If\nnecessary, he will break the message into pieces such that each piece is a positive integer\nless than n. Suppose x is one of the pieces. Bob forms the number y = xE mod n and\nsends y to Alice. For Alice to recover x, she need only compute x = yD mod n. Only Alice\nknows D.\nExample 7.5 Before exploring the theory behind the rsa cryptosystem or attempting to\nuse large integers, we will use some small integers just to see that the system does indeed\nwork. Suppose that we wish to send some message, which when digitized is 25. Let p = 23\nand q = 29. Then\nn = pq = 667\nand\nϕ(n) = m = (p(cid:0)1)(q(cid:0)1) = 616.\nWe can let E = 487, since gcd(616,487) = 1.

Then by\nTheorem 6.18,\nyD = (xE)D = xDE = xkm+1 = (xϕ(n))kx = (1)kx = x mod n.\nSo we see that Alice recovers the original message x when she computes yD mod n.\nFor the other case, assume that gcd(x,n) 6= 1. Since n = pq and x < n, we know x is\na multiple of p or a multiple of q, but not both. We will describe the first possibility only,\nsince the second is entirely similar. There is then an integer r, with r < q and x = rp. Note\nthat we have gcd(x,q) = 1 and that m = ϕ(n) = (p(cid:0)1)(q (cid:0)1) = ϕ(p)ϕ(q).

Since the encoding\nkey is public knowledge, anyone has the ability to send an encoded message. If Alice\nreceives a message from Bob, she would like to be able to verify that it was Bob who\n′ ′\nactually sent the message. Suppose that Bob’s encrypting key is (n,E ) and his decrypting\n′ ′\nkey is (n,D ). Also, suppose that Alice’s encrypting key is (n,E) and her decrypting key is\n(n,D). Since encryption keys are public information, they can exchange coded messages at\ntheir convenience. Bob wishes to assure Alice that the message he is sending is authentic.\nBefore Bob sends the message x to Alice, he decrypts x with his own key:\nx′\n=\nxD′\nmod\nn′\n.\n′\nAnyone can change x back to x just by encryption, but only Bob has the ability to form\n′ ′\nx. Now Bob encrypts x with Alice’s encryption key to form\n′ ′E\ny = x mod n,\na message that only Alice can decode. Alice decodes the message and then encodes the\nresult with Bob’s key to read the original message, a message that could have only been\nsent by Bob.\nHistorical Note\nEncrypting secret messages goes as far back as ancient Greece and Rome. As we know,\nJulius Caesar used a simple shift code to send and receive messages. However, the formal\nstudy of encoding and decoding messages probably began with the Arabs in the 1400s.

These messages are encoded into codewords, consisting of binary n-\ntuples, by a device called an encoder. The message is transmitted and then decoded. We\nwill consider the occurrence of errors during transmission. An error occurs if there is a\nchange in one or more bits in the codeword. A decoding scheme is a method that either\nconverts an arbitrarily received n-tuple into a meaningful decoded message or gives an error\nmessage for that n-tuple. If the received message is a codeword (one of the special n-tuples\nallowed to be transmitted), then the decoded message must be the unique message that\nwas encoded into the codeword. For received non-codewords, the decoding scheme will give\nan error indication, or, if we are more clever, will actually try to correct the error and\nreconstruct the original message. Our goal is to transmit error-free messages as cheaply\nand quickly as possible.\nExample 8.2 One possible coding scheme would be to send a message several times and to\ncompare the received copies with one another. Suppose that the message to be encoded is\na binary n-tuple (x ,x ,...,x ). The message is encoded into a binary 3n-tuple by simply\n1 2 n\nrepeating the message three times:\n(x ,x ,...,x ) 7!

If there is a transmission error in\nthe fifth digit, then the received codeword will be (0110 1110 0110), which will be correctly\ndecoded as (0110).6 This triple-repetition method will automatically detect and correct all\nsingle errors, but it is slow and ineﬀicient: to send a message consisting of n bits, 2n extra\nbits are required, and we can only detect and correct single errors. We will see that it is\npossible to find an encoding scheme that will encode a message of n bits into m bits with\nm much smaller than 3n. □\nExample 8.3 Evenparity,acommonlyusedcodingscheme,ismuchmoreeﬀicientthanthe\nsimplerepetitionscheme.

Weknowanerrorhasoccurredsince\nthe received word has an odd number of 1s, and we can now request that the codeword be\ntransmitted again. When used for error checking, the leftmost bit is called a parity check\nbit.\nBy far the most common error-detecting codes used in computers are based on the\naddition of a parity bit. Typically, a computer stores information in m-tuples called words.\nCommon word lengths are 8, 16, and 32 bits. One bit in the word is set aside as the parity\ncheck bit, and is not used to store information. This bit is set to either 0 or 1, depending\non the number of 1s in the word.\nAdding a parity check bit allows the detection of all single errors because changing a\nsingle bit either increases or decreases the number of 1s by one, and in either case the parity\nhas been changed from even to odd, so the new word is not a codeword. (We could also\nconstruct an error detection scheme based on odd parity; that is, we could set the parity\ncheck bit so that a codeword always has an odd number of 1s.) □\nThe even parity system is easy to implement, but has two drawbacks.

Table 8.5 also shows the number of bits by which each received\n3-tuple differs from each original codeword. □\nMaximum-Likelihood Decoding\nThe coding scheme presented in Example 8.4 is not a complete solution to the problem\nbecause it does not account for the possibility of multiple errors. For example, either a\n(000) or a (111) could be sent and a (001) received. We have no means of deciding from the\nreceived word whether there was a single error in the third bit or two errors, one in the first\nbit and one in the second. No matter what coding scheme is used, an incorrect message\ncould be received. We could transmit a (000), have errors in all three bits, and receive\nthe codeword (111). It is important to make explicit assumptions about the likelihood and\ndistribution of transmission errors so that, in a particular application, it will be known\nwhether a given error detection scheme is appropriate. We will assume that transmission\nerrors are rare, and, that when they do occur, they occur independently in each bit; that is,\nif p is the probability of an error in one bit and q is the probability of an error in a different\nbit, then the probability of errors occurring in both of these bits at the same time is pq.\nWe will also assume that a received n-tuple is decoded into a codeword that is closest to it;\nthat is, we assume that the receiver uses maximum-likelihood decoding. 7\n7This section requires a knowledge of probability, but can be skipped without loss of continuity."

More specifically, an (n,m)-block code consists of an encoding function\nE : Zm ! Zn\n2 2\nand a decoding function\nD : Zn ! Zm.\n2 2\nA codeword is any element in the image of E. We also require that E be one-to-one so that\ntwo information blocks will not be encoded into the same codeword. If our code is to be\nerror-correcting, then D must be onto.\nExample 8.9 The even-parity coding system developed to detect single errors in ascii\ncharacters is an (8,7)-block code. The encoding function is\nE(x ,x ,...,x ) = (x ,x ,...,x ),\n7 6 1 8 7 1\nwhere x = x +x +(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+x with addition in Z . □\n8 7 6 1 2\nLet x = (x ,...,x ) and y = (y ,...,y ) be binary n-tuples. The Hamming distance or\n1 n 1 n\ndistance, d(x,y), betweenxandyisthenumberofbitsinwhichxandydiffer. Thedistance\nbetween two codewords is the minimum number of transmission errors required to change\none codeword into the other. The minimum distance for a code, d , is the minimum of\nmin\nall distances d(x,y), where x and y are distinct codewords. The weight, w(x), of a binary\ncodeword x is the number of 1s in x. Clearly, w(x) = d(x,0), where 0 = (00(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)0).\nExample 8.10 Let x = (10101), y = (11010), and z = (00011) be all of the codewords in\nsome code C. Then we have the following Hamming distances:\nd(x,y) = 4, d(x,z) = 3, d(y,z) = 3.\nThe minimum distance for this code is 3. We also have the following weights:\nw(x) = 3, w(y) = 3, w(z) = 2.\n□\nThe following proposition lists some basic properties about the weight of a codeword\nand the distance between two codewords. The proof is left as an exercise.\nProposition 8.11 Let x, y, and z be binary n-tuples. Then\n1. w(x) = d(x,0);"

If a code is set up carefully, we can use this\nfact to our advantage.\nSuppose that x = (1101) and y = (1100) are codewords in some code. If we transmit\n(1101) and an error occurs in the rightmost bit, then (1100) will be received. Since (1100) is\na codeword, the decoder will decode (1100) as the transmitted message. This code is clearly\nnot very appropriate for error detection. The problem is that d(x,y) = 1. If x = (1100) and\ny = (1010) are codewords, then d(x,y) = 2. If x is transmitted and a single error occurs,\nthen y can never be received. Table 8.12 gives the distances between all 4-bit codewords\nin which the first three bits carry information and the fourth is an even parity check bit.\nWe can see that the minimum distance here is 2; hence, the code is suitable as a single\nerror-detecting code.\nTable 8.12 Distances between 4-bit codewords\n0000 0011 0101 0110 1001 1010 1100 1111\n0000 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 4\n0011 2 0 2 2 2 2 4 2\n0101 2 2 0 2 2 4 2 2\n0110 2 2 2 0 4 2 2 2\n1001 2 2 2 4 0 2 2 2\n1010 2 2 4 2 2 0 2 2\n1100 2 4 2 2 2 2 0 2\n1111 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 0\nTo determine exactly what the error-detecting and error-correcting capabilities for a\ncode are, we need to analyze the minimum distance for the code. Let x and y be codewords.\nIf d(x,y) = 1 and an error occurs where x and y differ, then x is changed to y. The received\ncodeword is y and no error message is given. Now suppose d(x,y) = 2. Then a single error\ncannot change x to y. Therefore, if d = 2, we have the ability to detect single errors.\nmin\nHowever, suppose that d(x,y) = 2, y is sent, and a noncodeword z is received such that\nd(x,z) = d(y,z) = 1.\nThen the decoder cannot decide between x and y. Even though we are aware that an error\nhas occurred, we do not know what the error is.\nSuppose d (cid:21) 3. Then the maximum-likelihood decoding scheme corrects all single\nmin\nerrors. Starting with a codeword x, an error in the transmission of a single bit gives y with\nd(x,y) = 1, butd(z,y) (cid:21) 2foranyothercodewordz 6= x. Ifwedonotrequirethecorrection\nof errors, then we can detect multiple errors when a code has a minimum distance that is\ngreater than or equal to 3.\nTheorem 8.13 Let C be a code with d = 2n+1. Then C can correct any n or fewer\nmin\nerrors. Furthermore, any 2n or fewer errors can be detected in C.\nProof. Suppose that a codeword x is sent and the word y is received with at most n errors.\nThen d(x,y) (cid:20) n. If z is any codeword other than x, then\n2n+1 (cid:20) d(x,z) (cid:20) d(x,y)+d(y,z) (cid:20) n+d(y,z)."

Shannon’s paper, “A Mathematical Theory\nof Information” [7]. This paper offered an example of an algebraic code, and Shannon’s\nTheorem proclaimed exactly how good codes could be expected to be. Richard Hamming\nbeganworkingwithlinearcodesatBellLabsinthelate1940sandearly1950safterbecoming\nfrustrated because the programs that he was running could not recover from simple errors\ngenerated by noise. Coding theory has grown tremendously in the past several decades.\nThe Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, by MacWilliams and Sloane [5], published in 1977,\nalreadycontainedover1500 references. Linear codes (Reed-Muller(32,6)-blockcodes) were\nusedonNASA’sMarinerspaceprobes. MorerecentspaceprobessuchasVoyagerhaveused\nwhatarecalledconvolutioncodes. Currently, veryactiveresearchisbeingdonewithGoppa\ncodes, which are heavily dependent on algebraic geometry.\n8.2 Linear Codes\nTo gain more knowledge of a particular code and develop more eﬀicient techniques of encod-\ning, decoding, and error detection, we need to add additional structure to our codes. One\nway to accomplish this is to require that the code also be a group. A group code is a code\nthat is also a subgroup of Zn.\n2\nTo check that a code is a group code, we need only verify one thing. If we add any\ntwo elements in the code, the result must be an n-tuple that is again in the code. It is not\nnecessary to check that the inverse of the n-tuple is in the code, since every codeword is its\nown inverse, nor is it necessary to check that 0 is a codeword. For instance,\n(11000101)+(11000101) = (00000000).\nExample 8.16 Suppose that we have a code that consists of the following 7-tuples:\n(0000000) (0001111) (0010101) (0011010)\n(0100110) (0101001) (0110011) (0111100)\n(1000011) (1001100) (1010110) (1011001)\n(1100101) (1101010) (1110000) (1111111).\nIt is a straightforward though tedious task to verify that this code is also a subgroup of Z7\n2\nand,therefore,agroupcode.

It is much easier to see that the minimum weight\nmin\nof all the nonzero codewords is 3. As we will soon see, this is no coincidence. However, the\nrelationship between weights and distances in a particular code is heavily dependent on the\nfact that the code is a group. □\nLemma 8.17 Let x and y be binary n-tuples. Then w(x+y) = d(x,y).\nProof. Suppose that x and y are binary n-tuples. Then the distance between x and y\nis exactly the number of places in which x and y differ. But x and y differ in a particular\ncoordinate exactly when the sum in the coordinate is 1, since\n1+1 = 0\n0+0 = 0\n1+0 = 1\n0+1 = 1.\nConsequently, the weight of the sum must be the distance between the two codewords. ■\nTheorem 8.18 Let d be the minimum distance for a group code C. Then d is the\nmin min\nminimum weight of all the nonzero codewords in C. That is,\nd = minfw(x) : x 6= 0g.\nmin\nProof.

We have now reduced the problem\nof finding “good” codes to that of generating group codes. One easy way to generate group\ncodes is to employ a bit of matrix theory.\nDefine the inner product of two binary n-tuples to be\nx(cid:1)y = x y +(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+x y ,\n1 1 n n\nwhere x = (x ,x ,...,x )t and y = (y ,y ,...,y )t are column vectors.8 For example, if\n1 2 n 1 2 n\nx = (011001)t and y = (110101)t, then x(cid:1)y = 0.

That is, (1100), (1010), (1001), (0110), (0101), and (0011) must not be in\nNull(H). The next theorem states that we can indeed determine that the code generated\nby H is error-correcting by examining the columns of H. Notice in this example that not\nonly does H have no zero columns, but also that no two columns are the same. □\nTheorem 8.34 Let H be a binary matrix. The null space of H is a single error-correcting\ncode if and only if H does not contain any zero columns and no two columns of H are\nidentical.\nProof. The n-tuple e + e has 1s in the ith and jth entries and 0s elsewhere, and\ni j\nw(e +e ) = 2 for i 6= j. Since\ni j\n0 = H(e +e ) = He +He\ni j i j\ncan only occur if the ith and jth columns are identical, the null space of H is a single\nerror-correcting code. ■\nSuppose now that we have a canonical parity-check matrix H with three rows.

Each column has m bits, so there are 2m possible distinct\ncolumns. It is necessary that the columns 0,e ,...,e be excluded, leaving 2m (cid:0)(1+m)\n1 m\nremaining columns for information if we are still to maintain the ability not only to detect\nbut also to correct single errors.\n8.4 Eﬀicient Decoding\nWe are now at the stage where we are able to generate linear codes that detect and correct\nerrors fairly easily, but it is still a time-consuming process to decode a received n-tuple and\ndetermine which is the closest codeword, because the received n-tuple must be compared to\neachpossiblecodewordtodeterminetheproperdecoding. Thiscanbeaseriousimpediment\nif the code is very large.\nExample 8.35 Given the binary matrix\n0 1\n1 1 1 0 0\n@ A\nH = 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 0 1\nand the 5-tuples x = (11011)t and y = (01011)t, we can compute\n0 1 0 1\n0 1\n@ A @ A\nHx = 0 and Hy = 0 .\n0 1\nHence, x is a codeword and y is not, since x is in the null space and y is not. Notice that\nHy is identical to the first column of H. In fact, this is where the error occurred. If we flip\nthe first bit in y from 0 to 1, then we obtain x. □\nIf H is an m(cid:2)n matrix and x 2 Zn, then we say that the syndrome of x is Hx. The\n2\nfollowing proposition allows the quick detection and correction of errors.\nProposition 8.36 Let the m(cid:2)n binary matrix H determine a linear code and let x be the\nreceived n-tuple. Write x as x = c+e, where c is the transmitted codeword and e is the\ntransmission error. Then the syndrome Hx of the received codeword x is also the syndrome\nof the error e.\nProof. The proof follows from the fact that\nHx = H(c+e) = Hc+He = 0+He = He.\n■\nThis proposition tells us that the syndrome of a received word depends solely on the\nerror and not on the transmitted codeword. The proof of the following theorem follows\nimmediately from Proposition 8.36 and from the fact that He is the ith column of the\nmatrix H.\nTheorem 8.37 Let H 2 M m×n(Z 2) and suppose that the linear code corresponding to H\nis single error-correcting. Let r be a received n-tuple that was transmitted with at most one\nerror. If the syndrome of r is 0, then no error has occurred; otherwise, if the syndrome of r\nis equal to some column of H, say the ith column, then the error has occurred in the ith bit."

However, this is exactly\nthe statement that r is an element in the coset e + C. In maximum-likelihood decoding\nwe expect the error e to be as small as possible; that is, e will have the least weight. An\nn-tuple of least weight in a coset is called a coset leader. Once we have determined a coset\nleader for each coset, the decoding process becomes a task of calculating r+e to obtain x.\nExample 8.41 In Table 8.40, notice that we have chosen a representative of the least\npossible weight for each coset. These representatives are coset leaders. Now suppose that\nr = (01111) is the received word. To decode r, we find that it is in the coset (00010)+C;\nhence, the originally transmitted codeword must have been (01101) = (01111)+(00010).\n□\nApotentialproblemwiththismethodofdecodingisthatwemighthavetoexamineevery\ncoset for the received codeword. The following proposition gives a method of implementing\ncoset decoding. It states that we can associate a syndrome with each coset; hence, we can\nmake a table that designates a coset leader corresponding to each syndrome. Such a list is\ncalled a decoding table.\nTable 8.42 Syndromes for each coset\nSyndrome Coset Leader\n(000) (00000)\n(001) (00001)\n(010) (00010)\n(011) (10000)\n(100) (00100)\n(101) (01000)\n(110) (00110)\n(111) (10100)\nProposition 8.43 Let C be an (n,k)-linear code given by the matrix H and suppose that\nx and y are in Zn. Then x and y are in the same coset of C if and only if Hx = Hy. That\n2\nis, two n-tuples are in the same coset if and only if their syndromes are the same.\nProof. Two n-tuples x and y are in the same coset of C exactly when x(cid:0)y 2 C; however,\nthis is equivalent to H(x(cid:0)y) = 0 or Hx = Hy. ■\nExample 8.44 Table 8.42 is a decoding table for the code C given in Example 8.39. If\nx = (01111) is received, then its syndrome can be computed to be\n0 1\n0\n@ A\nHx = 1 .\n0\nExamining the decoding table, we determine that the coset leader is (00010). It is now easy\nto decode the received codeword. □\nGiven an (n,k)-block code, the question arises of whether or not coset decoding is a\nmanageable scheme. A decoding table requires a list of cosets and syndromes, one for each\nof the\n2n−k\ncosets of C. Suppose that we have a (32,24)-block code. We have a huge\nnumber of codewords, 224, yet there are only 232−24 = 28 = 256 cosets.\nSage.

His legal knowledge was very valuable to\nCambridge; he participated in the writing of many of the university’s statutes. Cayley was\nalso one of the people responsible for the admission of women to Cambridge.\n9.2 Direct Products\nGiven two groups G and H, it is possible to construct a new group from the Cartesian\nproduct of G and H, G(cid:2)H. Conversely, given a large group, it is sometimes possible to\ndecompose the group; that is, a group is sometimes isomorphic to the direct product of\ntwo smaller groups. Rather than studying a large group G, it is often easier to study the\ncomponent groups of G.\nExternal Direct Products\nIf (G,(cid:1)) and (H,(cid:14)) are groups, then we can make the Cartesian product of G and H into a\nnew group. As a set, our group is just the ordered pairs (g,h) 2 G(cid:2)H where g 2 G and\nh 2 H. We can define a binary operation on G(cid:2)H by\n(g ,h )(g ,h ) = (g (cid:1)g ,h (cid:14)h );\n1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2\nthat is, we just multiply elements in the first coordinate as we do in G and elements in the\nsecond coordinate as we do in H. We have specified the particular operations (cid:1) and (cid:14) in\neach group here for the sake of clarity; we usually just write (g ,h )(g ,h ) = (g g ,h h ).\n1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2\nProposition 9.13 Let G and H be groups. The set G(cid:2)H is a group under the operation\n(g ,h )(g ,h ) = (g g ,h h ) where g ,g 2 G and h ,h 2 H.\n1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\nProof. Clearlythebinaryoperationdefinedaboveisclosed. Ife ande aretheidentities\nG H\nof the groups G and H respectively, then (e ,e ) is the identity of G(cid:2)H. The inverse of\nG H\n(g,h) 2 G(cid:2)H is (g−1,h−1). The fact that the operation is associative follows directly from\nthe associativity of G and H. ■\nExample 9.14 Let R be the group of real numbers under addition. The Cartesian product\nof R with itself, R(cid:2)R = R2, is also a group, in which the group operation is just addition in\neach coordinate; that is, (a,b)+(c,d) = (a+c,b+d). The identity is (0,0) and the inverse\nof (a,b) is ((cid:0)a,(cid:0)b). □\nExample 9.15 Consider\nZ (cid:2)Z = f(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)g.\n2 2\nAlthough Z (cid:2) Z and Z both contain four elements, they are not isomorphic. Every\n2 2 4\nelement (a,b) in Z (cid:2)Z other than the identity has order 2, since (a,b)+(a,b) = (0,0);\n2 2\nhowever, Z is cyclic. □\n4\nThe group G(cid:2)H is called the external direct product of G and H. Notice that there\nis nothing special about the fact that we have used only two groups to build a new group.\nThe direct product\nYn\nG = G (cid:2)G (cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)G\ni 1 2 n\ni=1\nof the groups G ,G ,...,G is defined in exactly the same manner.

The cosets of N in G form a\ngroup G/N of order [G : N].\nProof. The group operation on G/N is (aN)(bN) = abN. This operation must be shown\nto be well-defined; that is, group multiplication must be independent of the choice of coset\nrepresentative. Let aN = bN and cN = dN. We must show that\n(aN)(cN) = acN = bdN = (bN)(dN).\nThen a = bn and c = dn for some n and n in N.

However, the construction creates a new permuation group, isomorphic to\nthe quotient group, so its utility is limited.\nHistorical Note\nOne of the foremost problems of group theory has been to classify all simple finite groups.\nThis problem is over a century old and has been solved only in the last few decades of\nthe twentieth century. In a sense, finite simple groups are the building blocks of all finite\ngroups. The first nonabelian simple groups to be discovered were the alternating groups.\nGalois was the first to prove that A was simple. Later, mathematicians such as C. Jordan\n5\nand L. E. Dickson found several infinite families of matrix groups that were simple. Other\nfamilies of simple groups were discovered in the 1950s. At the turn of the century, William\nBurnside conjectured that all nonabelian simple groups must have even order. In 1963, W.\nFeit and J. Thompson proved Burnside’s conjecture and published their results in the paper\n“SolvabilityofGroupsofOddOrder,” whichappearedinthePacificJournalofMathematics.\nTheir proof, running over 250 pages, gave impetus to a program in the 1960s and 1970s\nto classify all finite simple groups. Daniel Gorenstein was the organizer of this remarkable\neffort. One of the last simple groups was the “Monster,” discovered by R. Greiss. The\nMonster, a 196,833 (cid:2) 196,833 matrix group, is one of the 26 sporadic, or special, simple\ngroups. These sporadic simple groups are groups that fit into no infinite family of simple\ngroups. Some of the sporadic groups play an important role in physics.\n10.3 Reading Questions\n1.

At the International Congress of\nMathematicians in 1900, David Hilbert gave a now-famous address outlining 23 problems\nto guide mathematics in the twentieth century. Hilbert’s eighteenth problem asked whether\nor not crystallographic groups in n dimensions were always finite. In 1910, L. Bieberbach\nproved that crystallographic groups are finite in every dimension. Finding out how many\nof these groups there are in each dimension is another matter. In R3 there are 230 different\nspace groups; in R4 there are 4783. No one has been able to compute the number of\nspace groups for R5 and beyond. It is interesting to note that the crystallographic groups\nwere found mathematically for R3 before the 230 different types of crystals were actually\ndiscovered in nature.\n12.3 Reading Questions\n1.

It is probably not reasonable to expect\nn\nthat we will ever know all groups; however, we can often classify certain types of groups or\ndistinguish between groups in special cases.\nIn this chapter we will characterize all finite abelian groups. We shall also investigate\ngroups with sequences of subgroups. If a group has a sequence of subgroups, say\nG = H n (cid:27) H n−1 (cid:27) (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1) (cid:27) H 1 (cid:27) H 0 = feg,\nwhere each subgroup H is normal in H and each of the factor groups H /H is abelian,\ni i+1 i+1 i\nthen G is a solvable group. In addition to allowing us to distinguish between certain classes\nof groups, solvable groups turn out to be central to the study of solutions to polynomial\nequations.\n13.1 Finite Abelian Groups\nInourinvestigationofcyclicgroupswefoundthateverygroupofprimeorderwasisomorphic\n(cid:24)\nto Z , where p was a prime number. We also determined that Z = Z (cid:2) Z when\np mn m n\ngcd(m,n) = 1. In fact, much more is true. Every finite abelian group is isomorphic to a\ndirect product of cyclic groups of prime power order; that is, every finite abelian group is\nisomorphic to a group of the type\nZ pα 11 (cid:2)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:2)Z pα nn,\nwhere each p is prime (not necessarily distinct).\nk\nFirst, let us examine a slight generalization of finite abelian groups. Suppose that G\nis a group and let fg g be a set of elements in G, where i is in some index set I (not\ni\nnecessarily finite). The smallest subgroup of G containing all of the g ’s is the subgroup of\ni\nG generated by the g ’s. If this subgroup of G is in fact all of G, then G is generated by\ni\nthe set fg : i 2 Ig. In this case the g ’s are said to be the generators of G. If there is a\ni i\nfinite set fg : i 2 Ig that generates G, then G is finitely generated.\ni\nExample 13.1 Obviously, all finite groups are finitely generated. For example, the group\nS is generated by the permutations (12) and (123). The group Z(cid:2)Z is an infinite group\n3 n\nbut is finitely generated by f(1,0),(0,1)g. □\n158"

We need only show that K is a subgroup\nof G. If this is the case, then K = H, since H is the smallest subgroup containing all the\ng s.\ni\nClearly, the set K is closed under the group operation.

We can express any finite\nabelian group as a finite direct product of cyclic groups. More specifically, letting p be\nprime, we define a group G to be a p-group if every element in G has as its order a power\nof p.

If p is a prime that divides n,\nthen G contains an element of order p.\nProof. We will prove this lemma by induction. If n = 1, then there is nothing to show.\nNow suppose that the lemma is true for all groups of order k, where k < n. Furthermore,\nlet p be a prime that divides n.\nIf G has no proper nontrivial subgroups, then G = hai, where a is any element other\nthan the identity. By Exercise 4.5.39, the order of G must be prime. Since p divides n, we\nknow that p = n, and G contains p(cid:0)1 elements of order p.\nNow suppose that G contains a nontrivial proper subgroup H. Then 1 < jHj < n. If\np j jHj, then H contains an element of order p by induction and the lemma is true. Suppose\nthat p does not divide the order of H. Since G is abelian, it must be the case that H is a\nnormal subgroup of G, and jGj = jHj(cid:1)jG/Hj. Consequently, p must divide jG/Hj. Since\njG/Hj < jGj = n, we know that G/H contains an element aH of order p by the induction\nhypothesis. Thus,\nH = (aH)p = apH,\nand ap 2 H but a 2/ H. If jHj = r, then p and r are relatively prime, and there exist\nintegers s and t such that sp+tr = 1. Furthermore, the order of ap must divide r, and\n(ap)r = (ar)p = 1.\nWe claim that ar has order p. We must show that ar 6= 1. Suppose ar = 1. Then\na = asp+tr\n= aspatr\n= (ap)s(ar)t\n= (ap)s1\n= (ap)s.\nSince ap 2 H, it must be the case that a = (ap)s 2 H, which is a contradiction. Therefore,\nar 6= 1 is an element of order p in G. ■\nLemma 13.6 is a special case of Cauchy’s Theorem (Theorem 15.1), which states that\nif G is a finite group and p a prime such that p divides the order of G, then G contains a\nsubgroup of order p. We will prove Cauchy’s Theorem in Chapter 15.\nLemma 13.7 A finite abelian group is a p-group if and only if its order is a power of p.\nProof. If jGj = pn then by Lagrange’s theorem, then the order of any g 2 G must divide\npn, and therefore must be a power of p. Conversely, if jGj is not a power of p, then it has\nsome other prime divisor q, so by Lemma 13.6, G has an element of order q and thus is not\na p-group. ■\nLemma 13.8 Let G be a finite abelian group of order n = pα1(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)pα k, where where p ,...,p\n1 k 1 k\nare distinct primes and α ,α ,...,α are positive integers.

By Lemma 13.7, we may assume that the order of G is pn. We shall induct on n.\nIf n = 1, then G is cyclic of order p and must be generated by g. Suppose now that the\nstatement of the lemma holds for all integers k with 1 (cid:20) k < n and let g be of maximal\norder in G, say jgj = pm. Then apm = e for all a 2 G. Now choose h in G such that h 2/ hgi,\nwhere h has the smallest possible order. Certainly such an h exists; otherwise, G = hgi and\nwe are done. Let H = hhi.\nWe claim that hgi\\H = feg. It suﬀices to show that jHj = p. Since jhpj = jhj/p, the\norder of hp is smaller than the order of h and must be in hgi by the minimality of h; that\nis, hp = gr for some number r. Hence,\n(gr)pm−1\n=\n(hp)pm−1\n=\nhpm\n= e,\nand the order of gr must be less than or equal to pm−1. Therefore, gr cannot generate hgi.\nNotice that p must occur as a factor of r, say r = ps, and hp = gr = gps. Define a to be\ng−sh. Then a cannot be in hgi; otherwise, h would also have to be in hgi. Also,\nap = g−sphp = g−rhp = h−php = e.\nWe have now formed an element a with order p such that a 2/ hgi.

If G is a group and X is an arbitrary set, a\ngroup action of an element g 2 G and x 2 X is a product, gx, living in X. Many problems\nin algebra are best be attacked via group actions. For example, the proofs of the Sylow\ntheorems and of Burnside’s Counting Theorem are most easily understood when they are\nformulated in terms of group actions.\n14.1 Groups Acting on Sets\nLet X be a set and G be a group. A (left) action of G on X is a map G(cid:2)X ! X given\nby (g,x) 7! gx, where\n1. ex = x for all x 2 X;\n2. (g g )x = g (g x) for all x 2 X and all g ,g 2 G.\n1 2 1 2 1 2\nUnder these considerations X is called a G-set. Notice that we are not requiring X to be\nrelated to G in any way. It is true that every group G acts on every set X by the trivial\naction (g,x) 7! x; however, group actions are more interesting if the set X is somehow\nrelated to the group G.\nExample 14.1 Let G = GL (R) and X = R2. Then G acts on X by left multiplication. If\n2\nv 2 R2 and I is the identity matrix, then Iv = v. If A and B are 2(cid:2)2 invertible matrices,\nthen (AB)v = A(Bv) since matrix multiplication is associative. □\nExample 14.2 LetG = D bethesymmetrygroupofasquare. IfX = f1,2,3,4gistheset\n4\nof vertices of the square, then we can consider D to consist of the following permutations:\n4\nf(1),(13),(24),(1432),(1234),(12)(34),(14)(23),(13)(24)g.\nThe elements of D act on X as functions. The permutation (13)(24) acts on vertex 1 by\n4\nsending it to vertex 3, on vertex 2 by sending it to vertex 4, and so on. It is easy to see that\nthe axioms of a group action are satisfied. □\nIn general, if X is any set and G is a subgroup of S , the group of all permutations\nX\nacting on X, then X is a G-set under the group action\n(σ,x) 7! σ(x)\nfor σ 2 G and x 2 X.\n168"

We write x (cid:24) y or x (cid:24) y if two elements are G-equivalent.\nG\nProposition 14.6 Let X be a G-set. Then G-equivalence is an equivalence relation on X.\nProof. The relation (cid:24) is reflexive since ex = x. Suppose that x (cid:24) y for x,y 2 X. Then\nthere exists a g such that gx = y. In this case g−1y = x; hence, y (cid:24) x. To show that the\nrelation is transitive, suppose that x (cid:24) y and y (cid:24) z. Then there must exist group elements\ng and h such that gx = y and hy = z. So z = hy = (hg)x, and x is equivalent to z. ■\nIf X is a G-set, then each partition of X associated with G-equivalence is called an orbit\nof X under G.

Notice\nthat we can sometimes obtain equivalent colorings by simply applying a rigid motion to the\nsquare. For instance, as we have pointed out, if we color one of the vertices black and the\nremaining three white, it does not matter which vertex was colored black since a rotation\nwill give an equivalent coloring.\nThe symmetry group of a square, D , is given by the following permutations:\n4\n(1) (13) (24) (1432)\n(1234) (12)(34) (14)(23) (13)(24)\nThe group G acts on the set of vertices f1,2,3,4g in the usual manner. We can describe\nthe different colorings by mappings from X into Y = fB,Wg where B and W represent\nthe colors black and white, respectively. Each map f : X ! Y describes a way to color\nthe corners of the square. Every σ 2 D induces a permutation σe of the possible colorings\n4\ngiven by σe(f) = f (cid:14)σ for f : X ! Y. For example, suppose that f is defined by\nf(1) = B\nf(2) = W\nf(3) = W\nf(4) = W\nand σ = (12)(34). Then σe(f) = f (cid:14)σ sends vertex 2 to B and the remaining vertices to\nW. The set of all such σe is a permutation group Ge on the set of possible colorings. Let Xe\ne\ndenote the set of all possible colorings; that is, X is the set of all possible maps from X to\ne\nY. Now we must compute the number of G-equivalence classes.\n1.\nXe\n=\nXe\nsince the identity fixes every possible coloring.\njXej\n= 24 = 16.\n(1)\n2. Xe consists of all f 2 Xe such that f is unchanged by the permutation (1234).\n(1234)\nIn this case f(1) = f(2) = f(3) = f(4), so that all values of f must be the same; that\nis, either f(x) = B or f(x) = W for every vertex x of the square. So jXe j = 2.\n(1234)\n3. jXe j = 2.\n(1432)\n4. For Xe , f(1) = f(3) and f(2) = f(4). Thus, jXe j = 22 = 4.\n(13)(24) (13)(24)"

Then G induces a group Ge that permutes the elements of Xe , where σe 2 Ge is defined\nby σe(f) = f (cid:14)σ for σ 2 G and f 2 Xe . Furthermore, if n is the number of cycles in the\ncycle decomposition of σ, then jXe j = jYjn.\nσ\nProof. Let σ 2 G and f 2 Xe . Since σ permutes the elements of X, f (cid:14)σ must also be in\nXe . Suppose that g is another function from X to Y such that σe(f) = σe(g). Then for each\nx 2 X,\nf(σ(x)) = σe(f)(x) = σe(g)(x) = g(σ(x)).\n′\nSince σ is a permutation of X, every element x in X is the image of some x in X under σ;\nhence, f and g agree on all elements of X. Therefore, f = g and σe is injective. The map\nσ 7! σe is onto, since the two sets are the same size.\nSuppose that σ is a permutation of X with cycle decomposition σ = σ σ (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)σ . Any\n1 2 n\nf in Xe must have the same value on each cycle of σ. Since there are n cycles and jYj\nσ\npossible values for each cycle, jXe j = jYjn. ■\nσ\nExample 14.22 Let X = f1,2,...,7g and suppose that Y = fA,B,Cg. If g is the\npermutation of X given by (13)(245) = (13)(245)(6)(7), then n = 4. Any f 2 Xe must\ng\nhave the same value on each cycle in g. There are jYj = 3 such choices for any value, so\njXe j = 34 = 81. □\ng\nExample 14.23 Suppose that we wish to color the vertices of a square using four different\ncolors. By Proposition 14.21, we can immediately decide that there are\n1\n(44+41+42+41+42+42+43+43) = 55\n8\npossible ways. □\nSwitching Functions\nIn switching theory we are concerned with the design of electronic circuits with binary\ninputs and outputs. The simplest of these circuits is a switching function that has n inputs\nand a single output (Figure 14.24). Large electronic circuits can often be constructed by\ncombiningsmallermodulesofthiskind.

However, the Sylow\n4\nTheorems do provide a partial converse for Lagrange’s Theorem—in certain cases they\nguarantee us subgroups of specific orders. These theorems yield a powerful set of tools for\nthe classification of all finite nonabelian groups.\n15.1 The Sylow Theorems\nWe will use what we have learned about group actions to prove the Sylow Theorems. Recall\nfor a moment what it means for G to act on itself by conjugation and how conjugacy\nclasses are distributed in the group according to the class equation, discussed in Chapter 14.\nA group G acts on itself by conjugation via the map (g,x) 7! gxg−1.

A group G is a p-group if every element in G has as its order a power of\np, where p is a prime number. A subgroup of a group G is a p-subgroup if it is a p-group.\nTheorem 15.1 Cauchy. Let G be a finite group and p a prime such that p divides the\norder of G. Then G contains a subgroup of order p.\nProof. We will use induction on the order of G. If jGj = p, then clearly G itself is the\nrequired subgroup. We now assume that every group of order k, where p (cid:20) k < n and p\ndivides k, has an element of order p. Assume that jGj = n and p j n and consider the class\nequation of G:\njGj = jZ(G)j+[G : C(x )]+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+[G : C(x )].\n1 k\nWe have two cases.\nCase 1.

Since Z(G) is abelian, it must have a subgroup of order p by the\nFundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. Therefore, the center of G contains an\nelement of order p. ■\nCorollary 15.2 Let G be a finite group. Then G is a p-group if and only if jGj = pn.\nExample 15.3 Let us consider the group A .

The proof is very\nsimilar to the proof of Cauchy’s Theorem.\nTheorem 15.4 First Sylow Theorem. Let G be a finite group and p a prime such that\npr divides jGj. Then G contains a subgroup of order pr.\nProof. We induct on the order of G once again. If jGj = p, then we are done. Now\nsuppose that the order of G is n with n > p and that the theorem is true for all groups of\norder less than n, where p divides n. We shall apply the class equation once again:\njGj = jZ(G)j+[G : C(x )]+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+[G : C(x )].\n1 k\nFirst suppose that p does not divide [G : C(x )] for some i.

Since p divides jGj, the class\ni\nequationsaysthatpmustdividejZ(G)j; hence, byCauchy’sTheorem, Z(G)hasanelement\nof order p, say g. Let N be the group generated by g. Clearly, N is a normal subgroup\nof Z(G) since Z(G) is abelian; therefore, N is normal in G since every element in Z(G)\ncommutes with every element in G. Now consider the factor group G/N of order jGj/p. By\nthe induction hypothesis, G/N contains a subgroup H of order\npr−1.\nThe inverse image of\nH under the canonical homomorphism ϕ : G ! G/N is a subgroup of order pr in G. ■\nA Sylow p-subgroup P of a group G is a maximal p-subgroup of G. To prove the other\ntwo Sylow Theorems, we need to consider conjugate subgroups as opposed to conjugate\nelements in a group. For a group G, let S be the collection of all subgroups of G. For any\nsubgroup H, S is a H-set, where H acts on S by conjugation. That is, we have an action\nH (cid:2)S !

In fact, N(H) is the largest subgroup of G in which H is normal.\nLemma 15.5 Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of a finite group G and let x have as its order\na power of p. If x−1Px = P, then x 2 P.\nProof. Certainly x 2 N(P), and the cyclic subgroup, hxPi (cid:26) N(P)/P, has as its order a\npower of p. By the Correspondence Theorem there exists a subgroup H of N(P) containing\nP such that H/P = hxPi. Since jHj = jPj(cid:1)jhxPij, the order of H must be a power of p.\nHowever, P is a Sylow p-subgroup contained in H. Since the order of P is the largest power\nof p dividing jGj, H = P.

Let G be a finite group and p a prime dividing\njGj. Then all Sylow p-subgroups of G are conjugate. That is, if P and P are two Sylow\n1 2\np-subgroups, there exists a g 2 G such that gP g−1 = P .\n1 2\nProof. Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup of G and suppose that jGj = prm with jPj = pr. Let\nS = fP = P ,P ,...,P g\n1 2 k\nconsist of the distinct conjugates of P in G. By Lemma 15.6, k = [G : N(P)]. Notice that\njGj = prm = jN(P)j(cid:1)[G : N(P)] = jN(P)j(cid:1)k.\nSince pr divides jN(P)j, p cannot divide k.\nGiven any other Sylow p-subgroup Q, we must show that Q 2 S. Consider the Q-\nconjugacy classes of each P . Clearly, these conjugacy classes partition S. The size of the\ni\npartition containing P is [Q : N(P )\\Q] by Lemma 15.6, and Lagrange’s Theorem tells us\ni i\nthat jQj = [Q : N(P )\\Q]jN(P )\\Qj. Thus, [Q : N(P )\\Q] must be a divisor of jQj = pr.\ni i i\nHence, the number of conjugates in every equivalence class of the partition is a power of\np.

Let P be a Sylow p-subgroup acting on the set of Sylow p-subgroups,\nS = fP = P ,P ,...,P g,\n1 2 k\nby conjugation. From the proof of the Second Sylow Theorem, the only P-conjugate of P\nis itself and the order of the other P-conjugacy classes is a power of p. Each P-conjugacy\nclass contributes a positive power of p toward jSj except the equivalence class fPg. Since\njSj is the sum of positive powers of p and 1, jSj (cid:17) 1 (mod p).\nNowsupposethatGactsonS byconjugation.

        "content": "CHAPTER 15. THE SYLOW THEOREMS 184\nHistorical Note\nPeter Ludvig Mejdell Sylow was born in 1832 in Christiania, Norway (now Oslo). After\nattendingChristianiaUniversity,Sylowtaughthighschool. In1862heobtainedatemporary\nappointment at Christiania University. Even though his appointment was relatively brief,\nhe influenced students such as Sophus Lie (1842–1899). Sylow had a chance at a permanent\nchair in 1869, but failed to obtain the appointment. In 1872, he published a 10-page paper\npresenting the theorems that now bear his name. Later Lie and Sylow collaborated on a\nnew edition of Abel’s works. In 1898, a chair at Christiania University was finally created\nfor Sylow through the efforts of his student and colleague Lie. Sylow died in 1918.\n15.2 Examples and Applications\nExample 15.9 Using the Sylow Theorems, we can determine that A has subgroups of\n5\norders 2, 3, 4, and 5. The Sylow p-subgroups of A have orders 3, 4, and 5. The Third\n5\nSylow Theorem tells us exactly how many Sylow p-subgroups A has. Since the number of\n5\nSylow 5-subgroups must divide 60 and also be congruent to 1 (mod 5), there are either one\nor six Sylow 5-subgroups in A . All Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate. If there were only\n5\na single Sylow 5-subgroup, it would be conjugate to itself; that is, it would be a normal\nsubgroup of A . Since A has no normal subgroups, this is impossible; hence, we have\n5 5\ndetermined that there are exactly six distinct Sylow 5-subgroups of A . □\n5\nThe Sylow Theorems allow us to prove many useful results about finite groups. By\nusing them, we can often conclude a great deal about groups of a particular order if certain\nhypotheses are satisfied.\nTheorem 15.10 If p and q are distinct primes with p < q, then every group G of order\npq has a single subgroup of order q and this subgroup is normal in G. Hence, G cannot be\nsimple. Furthermore, if q 6(cid:17) 1 (mod p), then G is cyclic.\nProof. We know that G contains a subgroup H of order q. The number of conjugates of\nH divides pq and is equal to 1+kq for k = 0,1,.... However, 1+q is already too large to\ndivide the order of the group; hence, H can only be conjugate to itself. That is, H must be\nnormal in G.\nThe group G also has a Sylow p-subgroup, say K. The number of conjugates of K must\ndivide q and be equal to 1 + kp for k = 0,1,.... Since q is prime, either 1 + kp = q or\n1+kp = 1. If 1+kp = 1, then K is normal in G. In this case, we can easily show that G\nsatisfies the criteria, given in Chapter 9, for the internal direct product of H and K. Since\n(cid:24) (cid:24)\nH is isomorphic to Z and K is isomorphic to Z , G = Z (cid:2)Z = Z by Theorem 9.21. ■\nq p p q pq\nExample 15.11 Every group of order 15 is cyclic. This is true because 15 = 5(cid:1)3 and 5 6(cid:17) 1\n(mod 3). □\nExample 15.12 Let us classify all of the groups of order 99 = 32 (cid:1)11 up to isomorphism.\nFirst we will show that every group G of order 99 is abelian. By the Third Sylow Theorem,\nthere are 1+3k Sylow 3-subgroups, each of order 9, for some k = 0,1,2,.... Also, 1+3k\nmustdivide11;hence,therecanonlybeasinglenormalSylow3-subgroupH inG. Similarly,\nthere are 1+11k Sylow 11-subgroups and 1+11k must divide 9. Consequently, there is only\none Sylow 11-subgroup K in G. By Corollary 14.16, any group of order p2 is abelian for p\nprime; hence, H is isomorphic either to Z (cid:2)Z or to Z . Since K has order 11, it must\n3 3 9\nbe isomorphic to Z . Therefore, the only possible groups of order 99 are Z (cid:2)Z (cid:2)Z or\n11 3 3 11\nZ (cid:2)Z up to isomorphism. □\n9 11\nTo determine all of the groups of order 5(cid:1)7(cid:1)47 = 1645, we need the following theorem."

Then\nG′\nis a normal subgroup of\n′\nG and G/G is abelian.\n′\nThe subgroup G of G is called the commutator subgroup of G. We leave the proof of\nthis theorem as an exercise (Exercise 10.4.14 in Chapter 10).\nExample 15.14 We will now show that every group of order 5(cid:1)7(cid:1)47 = 1645 is abelian, and\ncyclicbyTheorem9.21. BytheThirdSylowTheorem, GhasonlyonesubgroupH oforder\n1\n47. So G/H has order 35 and must be abelian by Theorem 15.10. Hence, the commutator\n1\nsubgroup of G is contained in H which tells us that\njG′j\nis either 1 or 47. If\njG′j\n= 1, we\nare done. Suppose that\njG′j\n= 47. The Third Sylow Theorem tells us that G has only one\nsubgroup of order 5 and one subgroup of order 7. So there exist normal subgroups H and\n2\nH in G, where jH j = 5 and jH j = 7. In either case the quotient group is abelian; hence,\n3 2 3\n′ ′\nG must be a subgroup of H , i = 1,2. Therefore, the order of G is 1, 5, or 7. However, we\ni\nalready have determined that\njG′j\n= 1 or 47. So the commutator subgroup of G is trivial,\nand consequently G is abelian. □\nFinite Simple Groups\nGiven a finite group, one can ask whether or not that group has any normal subgroups.\nRecall that a simple group is one with no proper nontrivial normal subgroups. As in the\ncase of A , proving a group to be simple can be a very diﬀicult task; however, the Sylow\n5\nTheorems are useful tools for proving that a group is not simple. Usually, some sort of\ncounting argument is involved.\nExample 15.15 Let us show that no group G of order 20 can be simple. By the Third\nSylow Theorem, G contains one or more Sylow 5-subgroups. The number of such subgroups\nis congruent to 1 (mod 5) and must also divide 20. The only possible such number is 1.\nSince there is only a single Sylow 5-subgroup and all Sylow 5-subgroups are conjugate, this\nsubgroup must be normal. □\nExample 15.16 LetGbe afinite groupof orderpn, n > 1andpprime. ByTheorem14.15,\nG has a nontrivial center. Since the center of any group G is a normal subgroup, G cannot\nbe a simple group. Therefore, groups of orders 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 49, 64, and 81 are not\nsimple. In fact, the groups of order 4, 9, 25, and 49 are abelian by Corollary 14.16. □\nExample 15.17 No group of order 56 = 23(cid:1)7 is simple. We have seen that if we can show\nthat there is only one Sylow p-subgroup for some prime p dividing 56, then this must be a\nnormal subgroup and we are done. By the Third Sylow Theorem, there are either one or\neight Sylow 7-subgroups. If there is only a single Sylow 7-subgroup, then it must be normal.\nOn the other hand, suppose that there are eight Sylow 7-subgroups. Then each of these\nsubgroups must be cyclic; hence, the intersection of any two of these subgroups contains\nonly the identity of the group. This leaves 8(cid:1)6 = 48 distinct elements in the group, each\nof order 7. Now let us count Sylow 2-subgroups. There are either one or seven Sylow\n2-subgroups. Any element of a Sylow 2-subgroup other than the identity must have as its\norder a power of 2; and therefore cannot be one of the 48 elements of order 7 in the Sylow\n7-subgroups. Since a Sylow 2-subgroup has order 8, there is only enough room for a single\nSylow 2-subgroup in a group of order 56. If there is only one Sylow 2-subgroup, it must be\nnormal. □\nFor other groups G, it is more diﬀicult to prove that G is not simple. Suppose G has\norder 48. In this case the technique that we employed in the last example will not work.\nWe need the following lemma to prove that no group of order 48 is simple."

If there\nis only one subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup.\nSuppose that the other case is true, and two of the three Sylow 2-subgroups are H and\nK. We claim that jH \\Kj = 8. If jH \\Kj (cid:20) 4, then by Lemma 15.18,\n16(cid:1)16\njHKj (cid:21) = 64,\n4\nwhich is impossible.

In fact, Z is\nan integral domain. Certainly if ab = 0 for two integers a and b, either a = 0 or b = 0.\nHowever, Z is not a field. There is no integer that is the multiplicative inverse of 2, since\n1/2 is not an integer. The only integers with multiplicative inverses are 1 and (cid:0)1. □\nExample 16.3 Under the ordinary operations of addition and multiplication, all of the\nfamiliar number systems are rings: the rationals, Q; the real numbers, R; and the complex\nnumbers, C. Each of these rings is a field. □\nExample 16.4 We can define the product of two elements a and b in Z by ab (mod n).\nn\nFor instance, in Z , 5(cid:1)7 (cid:17) 11 (mod 12).

Certainly Z is a commutative ring; however, it may fail to be an integral domain.\nn\nIf we consider 3(cid:1)4 (cid:17) 0 (mod 12) in Z , it is easy to see that a product of two nonzero\n12\nelements in the ring can be equal to zero. □\nAnonzeroelementainacommutativeringRiscalledazerodivisor ifthereisanonzero\nelement b in R such that ab = 0.

We add or multiply two functions by adding or multiplying the values\nof the functions. If f(x) = x2 and g(x) = cosx, then (f +g)(x) = f(x)+g(x) = x2+cosx\nand (fg)(x) = f(x)g(x) = x2cosx. □\nExample 16.6 The 2(cid:2)2 matrices with entries in R form a ring under the usual operations\nof matrix addition and multiplication.

A commutative ring with identity is said to be an integral domain if it has no zero\ndivisors. If an element a in a ring R with identity has a multiplicative inverse, we say that\na is a unit.

It is easily seen that the Gaussian integers are a subring of the\ncomplex numbers since they are closed under addition and multiplication. Let α = a+bi\nbe a unit in Z[i]. Then α = a(cid:0)bi is also a unit since if αβ = 1, then αβ = 1.

Let D be a commutative ring with identity. Then\nD is an integral domain if and only if for all nonzero elements a 2 D with ab = ac, we have\nb = c.\nProof. Let D be an integral domain. Then D has no zero divisors. Let ab = ac with\na 6= 0. Then a(b(cid:0)c) = 0. Hence, b(cid:0)c = 0 and b = c.\nConversely, let us suppose that cancellation is possible in D. That is, suppose that\nab = ac implies b = c. Let ab = 0. If a 6= 0, then ab = a0 or b = 0. Therefore, a cannot be\na zero divisor. ■\nThe following surprising theorem is due to Wedderburn.\nTheorem 16.16 Every finite integral domain is a field.\n∗\nProof. Let D be a finite integral domain and D be the set of nonzero elements of D. We\nmust show that every element in D∗ has an inverse. For each a 2 D∗ we can define a map\nλ : D∗ ! D∗ by λ (d) = ad. This map makes sense, because if a 6= 0 and d 6= 0, then\na a\nad 6= 0. The map λ is one-to-one, since for d ,d 2 D∗ ,\na 1 2\nad = λ (d ) = λ (d ) = ad\n1 a 1 a 2 2\n∗\nimplies d = d by left cancellation. Since D is a finite set, the map λ must also be\n1 2 a\nonto; hence, for some d 2 D∗ , λ (d) = ad = 1. Therefore, a has a left inverse. Since D is\na\ncommutative, d must also be a right inverse for a. Consequently, D is a field. ■\nFor any nonnegative integer n and any element r in a ring R we write r +(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+r (n\ntimes) as nr.

Thus, for\nall r 2 R,\nnr = n(1r) = (n1)r = 0r = 0.\nOn the other hand, if no positive n exists such that n1 = 0, then the characteristic of R is\nzero. ■\nTheorem 16.19 The characteristic of an integral domain is either prime or zero.\nProof. Let D be an integral domain and suppose that the characteristic of D is n with\nn 6= 0. If n is not prime, then n = ab, where 1 < a < n and 1 < b < n. By Lemma 16.18,\nwe need only consider the case n1 = 0. Since 0 = n1 = (ab)1 = (a1)(b1) and there are no\nzero divisors in D, either a1 = 0 or b1 = 0. Hence, the characteristic of D must be less than\nn, which is a contradiction. Therefore, n must be prime. ■\n16.3 Ring Homomorphisms and Ideals\nIn the study of groups, a homomorphism is a map that preserves the operation of the\ngroup. Similarly, a homomorphism between rings preserves the operations of addition and\nmultiplicationinthering. Morespecifically,ifRandS arerings,thenaringhomomorphism\nis a map ϕ : R !

S is a one-to-one and onto homomorphism, then ϕ is called an\nisomorphism of rings.\nThe set of elements that a ring homomorphism maps to 0 plays a fundamental role in\nthe theory of rings. For any ring homomorphism ϕ : R ! S, we define the kernel of a ring\nhomomorphism to be the set\nkerϕ = fr 2 R : ϕ(r) = 0g.\nExample 16.20 For any integer n we can define a ring homomorphism ϕ : Z ! Z by\nn\na 7! a (mod n). This is indeed a ring homomorphism, since\nϕ(a+b) = (a+b) (mod n)\n= a (mod n)+b (mod n)\n= ϕ(a)+ϕ(b)\nand\nϕ(ab) = ab (mod n)\n= a (mod n)(cid:1)b (mod n)\n= ϕ(a)ϕ(b).\nThe kernel of the homomorphism ϕ is nZ. □\nExample 16.21 Let C[a,b] be the ring of continuous real-valued functions on an interval\n[a,b] as in Example 16.5.

These subgroups\nhavenicecharacteristicsthatmakethemmoreinterestingtostudythanarbitrarysubgroups.\nIn ring theory the objects corresponding to normal subgroups are a special class of subrings\ncalled ideals. An ideal in a ring R is a subring I of R such that if a is in I and r is in R,\nthen both ar and ra are in I; that is, rI (cid:26) I and Ir (cid:26) I for all r 2 R.\nExample 16.23 Every ring R has at least two ideals, f0g and R. These ideals are called\nthe trivial ideals. □\nLet R be a ring with identity and suppose that I is an ideal in R such that 1 is in I.\nSince for any r 2 R, r1 = r 2 I by the definition of an ideal, I = R.\nExample 16.24 If a is any element in a commutative ring R with identity, then the set\nhai = far : r 2 Rg\nis an ideal in R. Certainly, hai is nonempty since both 0 = a0 and a = a1 are in hai. The\nsum of two elements in hai is again in hai since ar+ar′ = a(r+r′ ). The inverse of ar is\n(cid:0)ar = a((cid:0)r) 2 hai. Finally, if we multiply an element ar 2 hai by an arbitrary element\ns 2 R, we have s(ar) = a(sr). Therefore, hai satisfies the definition of an ideal. □\nIf R is a commutative ring with identity, then an ideal of the form hai = far : r 2 Rg\nis called a principal ideal.\nTheorem 16.25 Every ideal in the ring of integers Z is a principal ideal.\nProof. The zero ideal f0g is a principal ideal since h0i = f0g. If I is any nonzero ideal\nin Z, then I must contain some positive integer m. There exists a least positive integer n\nin I by the Principle of Well-Ordering. Now let a be any element in I. Using the division\nalgorithm, we know that there exist integers q and r such that\na = nq+r\nwhere 0 (cid:20) r < n. This equation tells us that r = a(cid:0)nq 2 I, but r must be 0 since n is the\nleast positive element in I. Therefore, a = nq and I = hni. ■\nExample 16.26 The set nZ is ideal in the ring of integers. If na is in nZ and b is in Z,\nthen nab is in nZ as required. In fact, by Theorem 16.25, these are the only ideals of Z. □\nProposition 16.27 The kernel of any ring homomorphism ϕ : R ! S is an ideal in R."

We already know that R/I is an abelian group under addition. Let r + I and\ns+I be in R/I. We must show that the product (r+I)(s+I) = rs+I is independent of\nthe choice of coset; that is, if r′ 2 r+I and s′ 2 s+I, then r′ s′ must be in rs+I. Since\nr′ 2 r+I, there exists an element a in I such that r′ = r+a. Similarly, there exists a b 2 I\n′\nsuch that s = s+b. Notice that\n′ ′\nr s = (r+a)(s+b) = rs+as+rb+ab\nand as+rb+ab 2 I since I is an ideal; consequently, r′ s′ 2 rs+I. We will leave as an\nexercise the verification of the associative law for multiplication and the distributive laws.\n■\nThe ring R/I in Theorem 16.29 is called the factor or quotient ring.

More specifically, we would like to char-\nacterize those ideals I of a commutative ring R such that R/I is an integral domain or a\nfield.\nA proper ideal M of a ring R is a maximal ideal of R if the ideal M is not a proper\nsubset of any ideal of R except R itself. That is, M is a maximal ideal if for any ideal I\nproperly containing M, I = R. The following theorem completely characterizes maximal\nideals for commutative rings with identity in terms of their corresponding factor rings.\nTheorem 16.35 Let R be a commutative ring with identity and M an ideal in R. Then\nM is a maximal ideal of R if and only if R/M is a field.\nProof. Let M be a maximal ideal in R. If R is a commutative ring, then R/M must also\nbe a commutative ring. Clearly, 1+M acts as an identity for R/M. We must also show\nthat every nonzero element in R/M has an inverse. If a+M is a nonzero element in R/M,\nthen a 2/ M. Define I to be the set fra+m : r 2 R and m 2 Mg. We will show that I is\nan ideal in R. The set I is nonempty since 0a+0 = 0 is in I.

If a 2/ P, then b must be in P by the definition of a prime ideal; hence,\nb+P = 0+P and R/P is an integral domain. ■\n(cid:24)\nExample 16.39 Every ideal in Z is of the form nZ. The factor ring Z/nZ = Z is an\nn\nintegral domain only when n is prime. It is actually a field. Hence, the nonzero prime ideals\nin Z are the ideals pZ, where p is prime. This example really justifies the use of the word\n“prime” in our definition of prime ideals. □\nSince every field is an integral domain, we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 16.40 Every maximal ideal in a commutative ring with identity is also a prime\nideal.\nHistorical Note\nAmalie Emmy Noether, one of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century,\nwas born in Erlangen, Germany in 1882. She was the daughter of Max Noether (1844–\n1921), a distinguished mathematician at the University of Erlangen. Together with Paul\nGordon (1837–1912), Emmy Noether’s father strongly influenced her early education. She\nentered the University of Erlangen at the age of 18. Although women had been admitted\nto universities in England, France, and Italy for decades, there was great resistance to\ntheir presence at universities in Germany. Noether was one of only two women among\nthe university’s 986 students. After completing her doctorate under Gordon in 1907, she\ncontinued to do research at Erlangen, occasionally lecturing when her father was ill.\n9It is possible to define prime ideals in a noncommutative ring.

Some of the faculty objected to women\nlecturers, saying, “What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are\nexpected to learn at the feet of a woman?” Hilbert, annoyed at the question, responded,\n“MeineHerren, Idonotseethatthesexofacandidateisanargumentagainstheradmission\nas a Privatdozent. After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse.” At the end of World War I,\nattitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women. After Noether passed her\nhabilitation examination in 1919, she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her\nlectures.\nIn 1922, Noether became a Privatdozent at Göttingen. Over the next 11 years she used\naxiomatic methods to develop an abstract theory of rings and ideals. Though she was not\ngood at lecturing, Noether was an inspiring teacher. One of her many students was B. L.\nvan der Waerden, author of the first text treating abstract algebra from a modern point of\nview. Some of the other mathematicians Noether influenced or closely worked with were\nAlexandroff, Artin, Brauer, Courant, Hasse, Hopf, Pontryagin, von Neumann, and Weyl.\nOne of the high points of her career was an invitation to address the International Congress\nof Mathematicians in Zurich in 1932. In spite of all the recognition she received from her\ncolleagues, Noether’s abilities were never recognized as they should have been during her\nlifetime. She was never promoted to full professor by the Prussian academic bureaucracy.\nIn 1933, Noether, who was Jewish, was banned from participation in all academic activities\nin Germany. She emigrated to the United States, took a position at Bryn Mawr College,\nand became a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. Noether died\nsuddenly on April 14, 1935. After her death she was eulogized by such notable scientists as\nAlbert Einstein.\n16.5 An Application to Software Design\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem is a result from elementary number theory about the\nsolutionofsystemsofsimultaneouscongruences.

A computer will handle integer calculations only up to\na certain size due to the size of its processor chip, which is usually a 32 or 64-bit processor\nchip. For example, the largest integer available on a computer with a 64-bit processor chip\nis\n263(cid:0)1 = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.\nLarger processors such as 128 or 256-bit have been proposed or are under development.\nThere is even talk of a 512-bit processor chip. The largest integer that such a chip could\nstore with be 2511(cid:0)1, which would be a 154 digit number. However, we would need to deal\nwith much larger numbers to break sophisticated encryption schemes.\nSpecial software is required for calculations involving larger integers which cannot be\nadded directly by the machine. By using the Chinese Remainder Theorem we can break\ndown large integer additions and multiplications into calculations that the computer can\nhandle directly. This is especially useful on parallel processing computers which have the\nability to run several programs concurrently.\nMost computers have a single central processing unit (CPU) containing one processor\nchip and can only add two numbers at a time. To add a list of ten numbers, the CPU must\ndo nine additions in sequence. However, a parallel processing computer has more than one\nCPU. A computer with 10 CPUs, for example, can perform 10 different additions at the\nsame time. If we can take a large integer and break it down into parts, sending each part\nto a different CPU, then by performing several additions or multiplications simultaneously\non those parts, we can work with an integer that the computer would not be able to handle\nas a whole.\nExample 16.45 Suppose that we wish to multiply 2134 by 1531. We will use the integers\n95, 97, 98, and 99 because they are relatively prime. We can break down each integer into"

By Corollary 17.15, any zero\nmust divide 1 and therefore must be (cid:6)1; however, p(1) = 1 and p((cid:0)1) = 3. Consequently,\nwe have eliminated the possibility that p(x) has any linear factors.\nTherefore, if p(x) is reducible it must factor into two quadratic polynomials, say\np(x) = (x2+ax+b)(x2+cx+d)\n= x4+(a+c)x3+(ac+b+d)x2+(ad+bc)x+bd,\nwhere each factor is in Z[x] by Gauss’s Lemma. Hence,\na+c = (cid:0)2\nac+b+d = 0\nad+bc = 1\nbd = 1.\nSince bd = 1, either b = d = 1 or b = d = (cid:0)1. In either case b = d and so\nad+bc = b(a+c) = 1.\nSince a+c = (cid:0)2, we know that (cid:0)2b = 1. This is impossible since b is an integer. Therefore,\np(x) must be irreducible over Q. □\nTheorem 17.17 Eisenstein’s Criterion. Let p be a prime and suppose that\nf(x) = a xn+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a 2 Z[x].\nn 0\nIf p j a for i = 0,1,...,n(cid:0)1, but p ∤ a and p2 ∤ a , then f(x) is irreducible over Q.\ni n 0\nProof. By Gauss’s Lemma, we need only show that f(x) does not factor into polynomials\nof lower degree in Z[x]. Let\nf(x) = (b xr +(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+b )(c xs+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+c )\nr 0 s 0\nbe a factorization in Z[x], with b and c not equal to zero and r,s < n. Since p2 does not\nr s\ndivide a = b c , either b or c is not divisible by p. Suppose that p ∤ b and p j c . Since\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\np ∤ a and a = b c , neither b nor c is divisible by p. Let m be the smallest value of k\nn n r s r s\nsuch that p ∤ c . Then\nk\na\nm\n= b 0c m+b 1c m−1+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+b mc\n0\nis not divisible by p, since each term on the right-hand side of the equation is divisible by p\nexcept for b c . Therefore, m = n since a is divisible by p for m < n. Hence, f(x) cannot\n0 m i\nbe factored into polynomials of lower degree and therefore must be irreducible. ■"

POLYNOMIALS 218\nExample 17.18 The polynomial\nf(x) = 16x5(cid:0)9x4+3x2+6x(cid:0)21\nis easily seen to be irreducible over Q by Eisenstein’s Criterion if we let p = 3. □\nEisenstein’s Criterion is more useful in constructing irreducible polynomials of a certain\ndegree over Q than in determining the irreducibility of an arbitrary polynomial in Q[x]:\ngiven an arbitrary polynomial, it is not very likely that we can apply Eisenstein’s Crite-\nrion. The real value of Theorem 17.17 is that we now have an easy method of generating\nirreducible polynomials of any degree.\nIdeals in F[x]\nLet F be a field. Recall that a principal ideal in F[x] is an ideal hp(x)i generated by some\npolynomial p(x); that is,\nhp(x)i = fp(x)q(x) : q(x) 2 F[x]g.\nExample 17.19 The polynomial x2 in F[x] generates the ideal hx2i consisting of all poly-\nnomials with no constant term or term of degree 1. □\nTheorem 17.20 If F is a field, then every ideal in F[x] is a principal ideal.\nProof. Let I be an ideal of F[x]. If I is the zero ideal, the theorem is easily true. Suppose\nthat I is a nontrivial ideal in F[x], and let p(x) 2 I be a nonzero element of minimal degree.\nIf degp(x) = 0, then p(x) is a nonzero constant and 1 must be in I. Since 1 generates all of\nF[x], h1i = I = F[x] and I is again a principal ideal.\nNow assume that degp(x) (cid:21) 1 and let f(x) be any element in I. By the division\nalgorithm there exist q(x) and r(x) in F[x] such that f(x) = p(x)q(x)+r(x) and degr(x) <\ndegp(x). Sincef(x),p(x) 2 I andI isanideal, r(x) = f(x)(cid:0)p(x)q(x)isalsoinI. However,\nsince we chose p(x) to be of minimal degree, r(x) must be the zero polynomial. Since we\ncan write any element f(x) in I as p(x)q(x) for some q(x) 2 F[x], it must be the case that\nI = hp(x)i. ■\nExample 17.21 It is not the case that every ideal in the ring F[x,y] is a principal ideal.\nConsider the ideal of F[x,y] generated by the polynomials x and y. This is the ideal of\nF[x,y] consisting of all polynomials with no constant term. Since both x and y are in the\nideal, no single polynomial can generate the entire ideal. □\nTheorem 17.22 Let F be a field and suppose that p(x) 2 F[x]. Then the ideal generated\nby p(x) is maximal if and only if p(x) is irreducible.\nProof. Suppose that p(x) generates a maximal ideal of F[x]. Then hp(x)i is also a prime\nideal of F[x]. Since a maximal ideal must be properly contained inside F[x], p(x) cannot\nbe a constant polynomial. Let us assume that p(x) factors into two polynomials of lesser\ndegree, say p(x) = f(x)g(x). Since hp(x)i is a prime ideal one of these factors, say f(x), is\nin hp(x)i and therefore be a multiple of p(x). But this would imply that hp(x)i (cid:26) hf(x)i,\nwhich is impossible since hp(x)i is maximal.\nConversely, suppose that p(x) is irreducible over F[x]. Let I be an ideal in F[x] contain-\ninghp(x)i. By Theorem17.20, I isa principal ideal; hence, I = hf(x)iforsome f(x) 2 F[x].\nSince p(x) 2 I, it must be the case that p(x) = f(x)g(x) for some g(x) 2 F[x]. However,\np(x) is irreducible; hence, either f(x) or g(x) is a constant polynomial. If f(x) is constant,\nthen I = F[x] and we are done. If g(x) is constant, then f(x) is a constant multiple of I\nand I = hp(x)i. Thus, there are no proper ideals of F[x] that properly contain hp(x)i. ■"

Polynomial rings are very important for computational approaches to algebra, and\nso Sage makes it very easy to compute with polynomials, over rings, or over fields. And it\nis trivial to check if a polynomial is irreducible.\nHistorical Note\nThroughout history, the solution of polynomial equations has been a challenging problem.\nThe Babylonians knew how to solve the equation ax2+bx+c = 0. Omar Khayyam (1048–\n1131)devisedmethodsofsolvingcubicequationsthroughtheuseofgeometricconstructions\nandconicsections. Thealgebraicsolutionofthegeneralcubicequationax3+bx2+cx+d = 0\nwas not discovered until the sixteenth century. An Italian mathematician, Luca Pacioli (ca.\n1445–1509), wrote in Summa de Arithmetica that the solution of the cubic was impossible.\nThis was taken as a challenge by the rest of the mathematical community.\nScipione del Ferro (1465–1526), of the University of Bologna, solved the “depressed cubic,”\nax3+cx+d = 0.\nHe kept his solution an absolute secret. This may seem surprising today, when mathe-\nmaticians are usually very eager to publish their results, but in the days of the Italian\nRenaissance secrecy was customary. Academic appointments were not easy to secure and\ndepended on the ability to prevail in public contests. Such challenges could be issued at\nany time. Consequently, any major new discovery was a valuable weapon in such a contest.\nIf an opponent presented a list of problems to be solved, del Ferro could in turn present a\nlist of depressed cubics. He kept the secret of his discovery throughout his life, passing it\non only on his deathbed to his student Antonio Fior (ca. 1506–?).\nAlthoughFiorwasnottheequalofhisteacher, heimmediatelyissuedachallengetoNiccolo\nFontana (1499–1557). Fontana was known as Tartaglia (the Stammerer). As a youth he\nhad suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village. He\nsurvived the savage wound, but his speech was permanently impaired. Tartaglia sent Fior\na list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of\n30 depressed cubics. Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail.\nAfter much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated\nFior, who faded into obscurity.\nAt this point another mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano (1501–1576), entered the story.\nCardano wrote to Tartaglia, begging him for the solution to the depressed cubic. Tartaglia\nrefused several of his requests, then finally revealed the solution to Cardano after the latter\nswore an oath not to publish the secret or to pass it on to anyone else. Using the knowledge\nthat he had obtained from Tartaglia, Cardano eventually solved the general cubic\nax3+bx2+cx+d = 0.\nCardano shared the secret with his student, Ludovico Ferrari (1522–1565), who solved the\ngeneral quartic equation,\nax4+bx3+cx2+dx+e = 0.\nIn 1543, Cardano and Ferrari examined del Ferro’s papers and discovered that he had also\nsolvedthedepressedcubic. CardanofeltthatthisrelievedhimofhisobligationtoTartaglia,\nso he proceeded to publish the solutions in Ars Magna (1545), in which he gave credit to\ndel Ferro for solving the special case of the cubic. This resulted in a bitter dispute between\nCardano and Tartaglia, who published the story of the oath a year later."

It was our first example of\nan algebraic structure: the first polynomial ring that we examined was Z[x]. We also know\nthat the integers sit naturally inside the field of rational numbers, Q. The ring of integers\nis the model for all integral domains. In this chapter we will examine integral domains in\ngeneral, answeringquestionsabouttheidealstructureofintegraldomains, polynomialrings\nover integral domains, and whether or not an integral domain can be embedded in a field.\n18.1 Fields of Fractions\nEvery field is also an integral domain; however, there are many integral domains that are\nnot fields. For example, the integers Z form an integral domain but not a field. A question\nthat naturally arises is how we might associate an integral domain with a field. There is a\nnatural way to construct the rationals Q from the integers: the rationals can be represented\nas formal quotients of two integers. The rational numbers are certainly a field. In fact, it\ncan be shown that the rationals are the smallest field that contains the integers. Given an\nintegraldomainD,ourquestionnowbecomeshowtoconstructasmallestfieldF containing\nD. We will do this in the same way as we constructed the rationals from the integers.\nAn element p/q 2 Q is the quotient of two integers p and q; however, different pairs of\nintegers can represent the same rational number. For instance, 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6. We know\nthat\na c\n=\nb d\nifandonlyifad = bc. Amoreformalwayofconsideringthisproblemistoexaminefractions\nin terms of equivalence relations. We can think of elements in Q as ordered pairs in Z(cid:2)Z.\nA quotient p/q can be written as (p,q). For instance, (3,7) would represent the fraction\n3/7. However, there are problems if we consider all possible pairs in Z(cid:2)Z. There is no\nfraction 5/0 corresponding to the pair (5,0). Also, the pairs (3,6) and (2,4) both represent\nthe fraction 1/2. The first problem is easily solved if we require the second coordinate to\nbe nonzero. The second problem is solved by considering two pairs (a,b) and (c,d) to be\nequivalent if ad = bc.\nIf we use the approach of ordered pairs instead of fractions, then we can study integral\ndomains in general. Let D be any integral domain and let\nS = f(a,b) : a,b 2 D and b 6= 0g.\nDefine a relation on S by (a,b) (cid:24) (c,d) if ad = bc.\nLemma 18.1 The relation (cid:24) between elements of S is an equivalence relation.\n225"

Therefore, (c,d) (cid:24) (a,b) and the relation is\nsymmetric. Finally, to show that the relation is transitive, let (a,b) (cid:24) (c,d) and (c,d) (cid:24)\n(e,f). In this case ad = bc and cf = de.

We will denote this field by Q(x). □\nWe will leave the proofs of the following corollaries of Theorem 18.4 as exercises.\nCorollary 18.6 Let F be a field of characteristic zero. Then F contains a subfield isomor-\nphic to Q.\nCorollary 18.7 Let F be a field of characteristic p. Then F contains a subfield isomorphic\nto Z .\np\n18.2 Factorization in Integral Domains\nThe building blocks of the integers are the prime numbers. If F is a field, then irreducible\npolynomials in F[x] play a role that is very similar to that of the prime numbers in the\nring of integers. Given an arbitrary integral domain, we are led to the following series of\ndefinitions.\nLet R be a commutative ring with identity, and let a and b be elements in R. We say\nthat a divides b, and write a j b, if there exists an element c 2 R such that b = ac. A unit\nin R is an element that has a multiplicative inverse. Two elements a and b in R are said to\nbe associates if there exists a unit u in R such that a = ub.\nLet D be an integral domain. A nonzero element p 2 D that is not a unit is said to be\nirreducible provided that whenever p = ab, either a or b is a unit. Furthermore, p is prime\nif whenever p j ab either p j a or p j b.\nExample 18.8 It is important to notice that prime and irreducible elements do not always\ncoincide. Let R be the subring (with identity) of Q[x,y] generated by x2, y2, and xy. Each\nof these elements is irreducible in R; however, xy is not prime, since xy divides x2y2 but\ndoes not divide either x2 or y2. □\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every positive integer n > 1 can\nbe factored into a product of prime numbers p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p , where the p ’s are not necessarily\n1 k i\ndistinct. We also know that such factorizations are unique up to the order of the p ’s. We\ni\ncan easily extend this result to the integers. The question arises of whether or not such\nfactorizations are possible in other rings. Generalizing this definition, we say an integral\ndomain D is a unique factorization domain, or ufd, if D satisfies the following criteria.\n1. Let a 2 D such that a 6= 0 and a is not a unit. Then a can be written as the product\nof irreducible elements in D.\n2. Let a = p (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)p = q (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)q , where the p ’s and the q ’s are irreducible. Then r = s\n1 r 1 s i i\nand there is a π 2 S such that p and q are associates for j = 1,...,r.\nr i π(j)\nExample 18.9 The integers are a unique factorization domain by the Fundamental Theo-\nrem of Arithmetic. □"

The subring\nZ[ 3i] = fa + b 3ig of tphe complex numberspis an integral domain (Exercise 16.7.12,\nChapter 16). Let z = a+b 3i and define ν : Z[ 3i] ! N[f0g by ν(z) = jzj2 = a2+3b2.\nIt is clear that ν(z) (cid:21) 0 with equality when z = 0. Also, from our knowledge of complex\nnumbers we know that ν(zw) = ν(pz)ν(w). It is easy to show that if ν(z) = 1, then z is a\nunit, and that the only units of Z[ 3i] are 1 and (cid:0)1.\nWe claim that 4 has two distinct factorizations into irreducible elements:\np p\n4 = 2(cid:1)2 = (1(cid:0) 3i)(1+ 3i).\np\nWe must show that each of these factors is an irpreducible element in Z[ 3i]. If 2 is not\nirreducible, then 2 = zw for elements z,wpin Z[ 3i] where ν(z) = ν(w) = 2. However,\nthere does not exist an element in z in Z[ 3i] such that ν(z) = 2 because the equation\na2+3b2 = 2 has no ipnteger solutipons. Therefore, 2 must be irreducible.

Since 2 is not a unit multiple of either\n1(cid:0) 3i or 1+ 3i, 4 has at least two distinct factorizations into irreducible elements. □\nPrincipal Ideal Domains\nLet R be a commutative ring with identity. Recall that a principal ideal generated by\na 2 R is an ideal of the form hai = fra : r 2 Rg. An integral domain in which every ideal\nis principal is called a principal ideal domain, or pid.\nLemma 18.11 Let D be an integral domain and let a,b 2 D. Then\n1. a j b if and only if hbi (cid:26) hai.\n2. a and b are associates if and only if hbi = hai.\n3. a is a unit in D if and only if hai = D.\nProof. (1) Suppose that a j b. Then b = ax for some x 2 D. Hence, for every r in\nD, br = (ax)r = a(xr) and hbi (cid:26) hai. Conversely, suppose that hbi (cid:26) hai. Then b 2 hai.\nConsequently, b = ax for some x 2 D. Thus, a j b.\n(2) Since a and b are associates, there exists a unit u such that a = ub. Therefore, b j a\nand hai (cid:26) hbi. Similarly, hbi (cid:26) hai. It follows that hai = hbi. Conversely, suppose that\nhai = hbi. Bypart(1), a j bandb j a. Thena = bxandb = ay forsomex,y 2 D. Therefore,\na = bx = ayx. Since D is an integral domain, xy = 1; that is, x and y are units and a and\nb are associates.\n(3) An element a 2 D is a unit if and only if a is an associate of 1. However, a is an\nassociate of 1 if and only if hai = h1i = D. ■\nTheorem 18.12 Let D be a pid and hpi be a nonzero ideal in D. Then hpi is a maximal\nideal if and only if p is irreducible.\nProof. Suppose that hpi is a maximal ideal. If some element a in D divides p, then\nhpi (cid:26) hai. Since hpi is maximal, either D = hai or hpi = hai. Consequently, either a and p\nare associates or a is a unit. Therefore, p is irreducible.\nConversely, let p be irreducible. If hai is an ideal in D such that hpi (cid:26) hai (cid:26) D, then\na j p. Since p is irreducible, either a must be a unit or a and p are associates. Therefore,\neither D = hai or hpi = hai. Thus, hpi is a maximal ideal. ■\nCorollary 18.13 Let D be a pid. If p is irreducible, then p is prime.\nProof. Let p be irreducible and suppose that p j ab. Then habi (cid:26) hpi. By Corollary 16.40,\nsince hpi is a maximal ideal, hpi must also be a prime ideal. Thus, either a 2 hpi or b 2 hpi.\nHence, either p j a or p j b. ■"

We\ncan find a ,b 2 D such that af(x) = a f (x) and bg(x) = b g (x), where f (x) and g (x)\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nare primitive polynomials in D[x]. Therefore, abp(x) = (a f (x))(b g (x)). Since f (x)\n1 1 1 1 1\nand g (x) are primitive polynomials, it must be the case that ab j a b by Gauss’s Lemma.\n1 1 1\nThus there exists a c 2 D such that p(x) = cf (x)g (x). Clearly, degf(x) = degf (x) and\n1 1 1\ndegg(x) = degg (x). ■\n1\nThe following corollaries are direct consequences of Lemma 18.26.\nCorollary 18.27 Let D be a ufd and F its field of fractions. A primitive polynomial p(x)\nin D[x] is irreducible in F[x] if and only if it is irreducible in D[x].\nCorollary 18.28 Let D be a ufd and F its field of fractions. If p(x) is a monic polynomial\nin D[x] with p(x) = f(x)g(x) in F[x], then p(x) = f (x)g (x), where f (x) and g (x) are in\n1 1 1 1\nD[x]. Furthermore, degf(x) = degf (x) and degg(x) = degg (x).\n1 1\nTheorem 18.29 If D is a ufd, then D[x] is a ufd.\nProof. Let p(x) be a nonzero polynomial in D[x]. If p(x) is a constant polynomial,\nthen it must have a unique factorization since D is a ufd. Now suppose that p(x) is\na polynomial of positive degree in D[x]. Let F be the field of fractions of D, and let\np(x) = f (x)f (x)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)f (x)byafactorizationofp(x),whereeachf (x)isirreducible. Choose\n1 2 n i\na 2 D such that a f (x) is in D[x]. There exist b ,...,b 2 D such that a f (x) = b g (x),\ni i i 1 n i i i i\nwhere g (x) is a primitive polynomial in D[x]. By Corollary 18.27, each g (x) is irreducible\ni i\nin D[x]. Consequently, we can write\na (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)a p(x) = b (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)b g (x)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)g (x).\n1 n 1 n 1 n\nLet b = b (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)b . Since g (x)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)g (x) is primitive, a (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)a divides b. Therefore, p(x) =\n1 n 1 n 1 n\nag (x)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)g (x), where a 2 D. Since D is a ufd, we can factor a as uc (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)c , where u is a\n1 n 1 k\nunit and each of the c ’s is irreducible in D.\ni\nWe will now show the uniqueness of this factorization. Let\np(x) = a (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)a f (x)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)f (x) = b (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)b g (x)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)g (x)\n1 m 1 n 1 r 1 s\nbe two factorizations of p(x), where all of the factors are irreducible in D[x]. By Corol-\nlary 18.27, each of the f ’s and g ’s is irreducible in F[x]. The a ’s and the b ’s are units\ni i i i\nin F. Since F[x] is a pid, it is a ufd; therefore, n = s. Now rearrange the g (x)’s so that\ni\nf (x) and g (x) are associates for i = 1,...,n. Then there exist c ,...,c and d ,...,d in\ni i 1 n 1 n\nD such that (c /d )f (x) = g (x) or c f (x) = d g (x). The polynomials f (x) and g (x) are\ni i i i i i i i i i\nprimitive; hence, c and d are associates in D. Thus, a (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)a = ub (cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)b in D, where u is\ni i 1 m 1 r\na unit in D. Since D is a unique factorization domain, m = s. Finally, we can reorder the\nb ’s so that a and b are associates for each i. This completes the uniqueness part of the\ni i i\nproof. ■\nThe theorem that we have just proven has several obvious but important corollaries."

Then D[x ,...,x ] is a ufd.\n1 n\nRemark 18.33 It is important to notice that every Euclidean domain is a pid and every\npid is a ufd. However, as demonstrated by our examples, the converse of each of these\nstatements fails. There are principal ideal domains that are not Euclidean domains, and\nthere are unique factorization domains that are not principal ideal domains (Z[x]).\nSage. Sage supports distinctions between “plain” rings, domains, principal ideal domains\nand fields. Support is often very good for constructions and computations with PID’s,\nbut sometimes problems get significantly harder (computationally) when a ring has less\nstructure that that of a PID. So be aware when using Sage that some questions may go\nunanswered for rings with less structure.\nHistorical Note\nKarl Friedrich Gauss, born in Brunswick, Germany on April 30, 1777, is considered to be\none of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Gauss was truly a child prodigy. At\nthe age of three he was able to detect errors in the books of his father’s business. Gauss\nentered college at the age of 15. Before the age of 20, Gauss was able to construct a regular\n17-sided polygon with a ruler and compass. This was the first new construction of a regular\nn-sided polygon since the time of the ancient Greeks. Gauss succeeded in showing that if\nN = 22n +1 was prime, then it was possible to construct a regular N-sided polygon.\nGaussobtainedhisPh.D.in1799underthedirectionofPfaffattheUniversityofHelmstedt.\nIn his dissertation he gave the first complete proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,\nwhich states that every polynomial with real coeﬀicients can be factored into linear factors\nover the complex numbers. The acceptance of complex nupmbers was brought about by\nGauss, who was the first person to use the notation of i for (cid:0)1.\nGauss then turned his attention toward number theory; in 1801, he published his famous\nbook on number theory, Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Throughout his life Gauss was in-\ntrigued with this branch of mathematics. He once wrote, “Mathematics is the queen of the\nsciences, and the theory of numbers is the queen of mathematics.”\nIn 1807, Gauss was appointed director of the Observatory at the University of Göttingen, a\nposition he held until his death. This position required him to study applications of math-\nematics to the sciences. He succeeded in making contributions to fields such as astronomy,\nmechanics, optics, geodesy, and magnetism. Along with Wilhelm Weber, he coinvented the\nfirst practical electric telegraph some years before a better version was invented by Samuel\nF. B. Morse.\nGauss was clearly the most prominent mathematician in the world in the early nineteenth\ncentury. His status naturally made his discoveries subject to intense scrutiny. Gauss’s cold\nanddistantpersonalitymanytimesledhimtoignoretheworkofhiscontemporaries,making\nhim many enemies. He did not enjoy teaching very much, and young mathematicians who\nsoughthimoutforencouragementwereoftenrebuffed. Nevertheless,hehadmanyoutstand-\ning students, including Eisenstein, Riemann, Kummer, Dirichlet, and Dedekind. Gauss also\noffered a great deal of encouragement to Sophie Germain (1776–1831), who overcame the\nmanyobstaclesfacingwomeninherdaytobecomeaveryprominentmathematician.

For example, the important operations on sets\nare inclusion, union, and intersection. Lattices are generalizations of order relations on\nalgebraic spaces, such as set inclusion in set theory and inequality in the familiar number\nsystems N, Z, Q, and R. Boolean algebras generalize the operations of intersection and\nunion. Lattices and Boolean algebras have found applications in logic, circuit theory, and\nprobability.\n19.1 Lattices\nPartially Ordered Sets\nWe begin the study of lattices and Boolean algebras by generalizing the idea of inequality.\nRecall that a relation on a set X is a subset of X(cid:2)X. A relation P on X is called a partial\norder of X if it satisfies the following axioms.\n1. The relation is reflexive: (a,a) 2 P for all a 2 X.\n2. The relation is antisymmetric: if (a,b) 2 P and (b,a) 2 P, then a = b.\n3. The relation is transitive: if (a,b) 2 P and (b,c) 2 P, then (a,c) 2 P.\nWe will usually write a (cid:22) b to mean (a,b) 2 P unless some symbol is naturally associated\nwith a particular partial order, such as a (cid:20) b with integers a and b, or A (cid:26) B with sets A\nand B. A set X together with a partial order (cid:22) is called a partially ordered set, or poset.\nExample 19.1 The set of integers (or rationals or reals) is a poset where a (cid:20) b has the\nusual meaning for two integers a and b in Z. □\nExample 19.2 Let X be any set. We will define the power set of X to be the set of all\nsubsets of X. We denote the power set of X by P(X). For example, let X = fa,b,cg. Then\nP(X) is the set of all subsets of the set fa,b,cg:\n; fag fbg fcg\nfa,bg fa,cg fb,cg fa,b,cg.\nOn any power set of a set X, set inclusion, (cid:26), is a partial order.

Then Y\nhas upper bounds 12 and 24, with 12 as a least upper bound. The only lower bound is 1;\nhence, it must be a greatest lower bound. □\nAs it turns out, least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds are unique if they exist.\nTheorem 19.9 Let Y be a nonempty subset of a poset X. If Y has a least upper bound,\nthen Y has a unique least upper bound. If Y has a greatest lower bound, then Y has a unique\ngreatest lower bound.\nProof. Let u and u be least upper bounds for Y.

A lattice is a poset L such that every\npair of elements in L has a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound. The least upper\nbound of a,b 2 L is called the join of a and b and is denoted by a_b.

For two sets\nA and B in P(X), the least upper bound of A and B is A[B. Certainly A[B is an upper\nbound of A and B, since A (cid:26) A[B and B (cid:26) A[B.

Any statement that is true for all lattices remains\ntrue when (cid:22) is replaced by (cid:23) and _ and ^ are interchanged throughout the statement.\nThe following theorem tells us that a lattice is an algebraic structure with two binary\noperations that satisfy certain axioms.\nTheorem 19.13 If L is a lattice, then the binary operations _ and ^ satisfy the following\nproperties for a,b,c 2 L.\n1.

The\nfollowing theorem says that this is always the case.\nTheorem 19.14 Let L be a nonempty set with two binary operations _ and ^ satisfying the\ncommutative, associative, idempotent, and absorption laws. We can define a partial order\non L by a (cid:22) b if a_b = b. Furthermore, L is a lattice with respect to (cid:22) if for all a,b 2 L,\nwe define the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of a and b by a _ b and a ^ b,\nrespectively.\nProof. We first show that L is a poset under (cid:22). Since a_a = a, a (cid:22) a and (cid:22) is reflexive.\nTo show that (cid:22) is antisymmetric, let a (cid:22) b and b (cid:22) a. Then a_b = b and b_a = a. By\nthe commutative law, b = a_b = b_a = a. Finally, we must show that (cid:22) is transitive. Let\na (cid:22) b and b (cid:22) c. Then a_b = b and b_c = c. Thus,\na_c = a_(b_c) = (a_b)_c = b_c = c,\nor a (cid:22) c.\nTo show that L is a lattice, we must prove that a_b and a^b are, respectively, the least\nupper and greatest lower bounds of a and b. Since a = (a_b)^a = a^(a_b), it follows\nthat a (cid:22) a_b. Similarly, b (cid:22) a_b. Therefore, a_b is an upper bound for a and b. Let u\nbe any other upper bound of both a and b. Then a (cid:22) u and b (cid:22) u.

The power\nset is a lattice that is ordered by inclusion. By the definition of the power set, the largest\nelement in P(X) is X itself and the smallest element is ;, the empty set. For any set A in\nP(X), we know that A\\X = A and A[; = A. This suggests the following definition for\nlattices. An element I in a poset X is a largest element if a (cid:22) I for all a 2 X. An element\nO is a smallest element of X if O (cid:22) a for all a 2 X.\nLet A be in P(X). Recall that the complement of A is\nA′ = X nA = fx : x 2 X and x 2/ Ag.\nWe know that A[A′ = X and A\\A′ = ;. We can generalize this example for lattices.\nA lattice L with a largest element I and a smallest element O is complemented if for each\na 2 L, there exists an a′ such that a_a′ = I and a^a′ = O.\nIn a lattice L, the binary operations _ and ^ satisfy commutative and associative laws;"

We will need a few lemmas and\ndefinitions before we prove this result. Let B be a finite Boolean algebra. An element\na 2 B is an atom of B if a 6= O and a^b = a for all b 2 B with b 6= O. Equivalently, a is\nan atom of B if there is no b 2 B with b 6= O distinct from a such that O (cid:22) b (cid:22) a.\nLemma 19.18 Let B be a finite Boolean algebra. If b is a element of B with b 6= O, then\nthere is an atom a in B such that a (cid:22) b.\nProof. If b is an atom, let a = b. Otherwise, choose an element b , not equal to O or b,\n1\nsuch that b (cid:22) b. We are guaranteed that this is possible since b is not an atom. If b is an\n1 1\natom, then we are done.

The circuit design of computer\nchips can be expressed in terms of Boolean algebras. In this section we will develop the\nBoolean algebra of electrical circuits and switches; however, these results can easily be\ngeneralized to the design of integrated computer circuitry.\nA switch is a device, located at some point in an electrical circuit, that controls the flow\nof current through the circuit. Each switch has two possible states: it can be open, and\nnot allow the passage of current through the circuit, or a it can be closed, and allow the\npassage of current. These states are mutually exclusive. We require that every switch be\nin one state or the other—a switch cannot be open and closed at the same time. Also, if\none switch is always in the same state as another, we will denote both by the same letter;\nthat is, two switches that are both labeled with the same letter a will always be open at\nthe same time and closed at the same time.\nGiven two switches, we can construct two fundamental types of circuits. Two switches\na and b are in series if they make up a circuit of the type that is illustrated in Figure 19.25.\nCurrent can pass between the terminals A and B in a series circuit only if both of the\nswitches a and b are closed. We will denote this combination of switches by a^b.

Sagehasafullsuiteoffunctionalityforbothposetsandlattices, allaspartofitsex-\ncellent support for combinatorics. There is little in this chapter that cannot be investigated\nwith Sage.\nHistorical Note\nGeorge Boole (1815–1864) was the first person to study lattices. In 1847, he published The\nInvestigation of the Laws of Thought, a book in which he used lattices to formalize logic\nand the calculus of propositions. Boole believed that mathematics was the study of form\nrather than of content; that is, he was not so much concerned with what he was calculating\nas with how he was calculating it. Boole’s work was carried on by his friend Augustus De\nMorgan (1806–1871). De Morgan observed that the principle of duality often held in set\ntheory, as is illustrated by De Morgan’s laws for set theory. He believed, as did Boole, that\nmathematics was the study of symbols and abstract operations.\nSet theory and logic were further advanced by such mathematicians as Alfred North White-\nhead (1861–1947), Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), and David Hilbert (1862–1943). In Prin-\ncipiaMathematica,WhiteheadandRussellattemptedtoshowtheconnectionbetweenmath-\nematics and logic by the deduction of the natural number system from the rules of formal\nlogic. If the natural numbers could be determined from logic itself, then so could much\nof the rest of existing mathematics. Hilbert attempted to build up mathematics by using\nsymbolic logic in a way that would prove the consistency of mathematics. His approach\nwas dealt a mortal blow by Kurt Gödel (1906–1978), who proved that there will always\nbe “undecidable” problems in any suﬀiciently rich axiomatic system; that is, that in any\nmathematical system of any consequence, there will always be statements that can never\nbe proven either true or false.\nAs often occurs, this basic research in pure mathematics later became indispensable in a\nwide variety of applications. Boolean algebras and logic have become essential in the design\nof the large-scale integrated circuitry found on today’s computer chips. Sociologists have\nused lattices and Boolean algebras to model social hierarchies; biologists have used them to\ndescribe biosystems.\n19.4 Reading Questions\n1. Describe succinctly what a poset is. Do not just list the defining properties, but\ngive a description that another student of algebra who has never seen a poset might\nunderstand.

For example,\nwe need to know only a single number to describe temperature, mass, or volume. However,\nfor some quantities, such as location, we need several numbers. To give the location of\na point in space, we need x, y, and z coordinates. Temperature distribution over a solid\nobject requires four numbers: three to identify each point within the object and a fourth\nto describe the temperature at that point. Often n-tuples of numbers, or vectors, also have\ncertain algebraic properties, such as addition or scalar multiplication.\nIn this chapter we will examine mathematical structures called vector spaces. As with\ngroups and rings, it is desirable to give a simple list of axioms that must be satisfied to\nmake a set of vectors a structure worth studying.\n20.1 Definitions and Examples\nA vector space V over a field F is an abelian group with a scalar product α(cid:1)v or αv defined\nfor all α 2 F and all v 2 V satisfying the following axioms.\n• α(βv) = (αβ)v;\n• (α+β)v = αv+βv;\n• α(u+v) = αu+αv;\n• 1v = v;\nwhere α,β 2 F and u,v 2 V.\nTheelementsofV arecalledvectors; theelementsofF arecalledscalars. Itisimportant\nto notice that in most cases two vectors cannot be multiplied. In general, it is only possible\nto multiply a vector with a scalar. To differentiate between the scalar zero and the vector\nzero, we will write them as 0 and 0, respectively.\nLet us examine several examples of vector spaces. Some of them will be quite familiar;\nothers will seem less so.\nExample 20.1 The n-tuples of real numbers, denoted by Rn, form a vector space over R.\nGiven vectors u = (u ,...,u ) and v = (v ,...,v ) in Rn and α in R, we can define vector\n1 n 1 n\naddition by\nu+v = (u ,...,u )+(v ,...,v ) = (u +v ,...,u +v )\n1 n 1 n 1 1 n n\nand scalar multiplication by\nαu = α(u ,...,u ) = (αu ,...,αu ).\n1 n 1 n\n252"

The vectors in F[x]\nare simply polynomials, and vector addition is just polynomial addition. If α 2 F and\np(x) 2 F[x], then scalar multiplication is defined by αp(x). □\nExample 20.3 The set of all continuous real-valued functions on a closed interval [a,b] is a\nvector space over R. If f(x) and g(x) are continuous on [a,b], then (f +g)(x) is defined to\nbe f(x)+g(x). Scalar multiplication is defined by (αf)(x) = αf(x) for α 2 R. For example,\nif f(x) = sinx and g(x) = x2, then (2f +5g)(x) = 2sinx+5x2. □\np p\nExample 20p.4 Let V = Q( 2p) = fa+b 2 : a,b 2 Qg. Then V ips a vector space over Q.\nIf u = a+b 2 and v = c+d 2, then u+v = (a+c)+(b+d) 2 is again in V. Also,\nfor α 2 Q, αv is in V. We will leave it as an exercise to verify that all of the vector space\naxioms hold for V. □\nProposition 20.5 Let V be a vector space over F. Then each of the following statements\nis true.\n1. 0v = 0 for all v 2 V.\n2. α0 = 0 for all α 2 F.\n3. If αv = 0, then either α = 0 or v = 0.\n4. ((cid:0)1)v = (cid:0)v for all v 2 V.\n5. (cid:0)(αv) = ((cid:0)α)v = α((cid:0)v) for all α 2 F and all v 2 V.\nProof. To prove (1), observe that\n0v = (0+0)v = 0v+0v;\nconsequently, 0+0v = 0v+0v. Since V is an abelian group, 0 = 0v.\nThe proof of (2) is almost identical to the proof of (1). For (3), we are done if α = 0.\nSuppose that α 6= 0. Multiplying both sides of αv = 0 by 1/α, we have v = 0.\nTo show (4), observe that\nv+((cid:0)1)v = 1v+((cid:0)1)v = (1(cid:0)1)v = 0v = 0,\nand so (cid:0)v = ((cid:0)1)v.

Then W is a subspace of V if\nit is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication; that is, if u,v 2 W and α 2 F,\nit will always be the case that u+v and αv are also in W.\nExample 20.6 Let W be the subspace of R3 defined by W = f(x ,2x + x ,x (cid:0) x ) :\n1 1 2 1 2\nx ,x 2 Rg.

The smallest field containing F[x] is the field of\nfractions F(x). By Theorem 18.4, E must contain a copy of this field. ■\nWe have a more interesting situation in the case of algebraic extensions.\nTheorem 21.10 Let E be an extension field of a field F and α 2 E with α algebraic over\nF. Then there is a unique irreducible monic polynomial p(x) 2 F[x] of smallest degree such\nthat p(α) = 0. If f(x) is another polynomial in F[x] such that f(α) = 0, then p(x) divides\nf(x).\nProof. Let ϕ : F[x] ! E be the evaluation homomorphism. The kernel of ϕ is a\nα α\nprincipal ideal generated by some p(x) 2 F[x] with degp(x) (cid:21) 1. We know that such a\npolynomial exists, since F[x] is a principal ideal domain and α is algebraic. The ideal hp(x)i\nconsists exactly of those elements of F[x] having α as a zero. If f(α) = 0 and f(x) is not\nthe zero polynomial, then f(x) 2 hp(x)i and p(x) divides f(x). So p(x) is a polynomial of\nminimal degree having α as a zero. Any other polynomial of the same degree having α as\na zero must have the form βp(x) for some β 2 F.\nSuppose now that p(x) = r(x)s(x) is a factorization of p(x) into polynomials of lower\ndegree. Since p(α) = 0, r(α)s(α) = 0; consequently, either r(α) = 0 or s(α) = 0, which\ncontradicts the fact that p is of minimal degree. Therefore, p(x) must be irreducible. ■\nLet E be an extension field of F and α 2 E be algebraic over F. The unique monic\npolynomial p(x) of the last theorem is called the minimal polynomial for α over F. The\ndegree of p(x) is the degree of α over F.\nExample 21.11 Let f( px) = x2 p(cid:0)2 an pd g(x) = x4 (cid:0)4x2 +1.

The kernel of this map is\nα\nhp(x)i, where p(x) is the minimal polynomial of α.

Let F be an algebraically closed field. If p(x) 2 F[x] is a nonconstant polynomial,\nthen p(x) has a zero in F, say α. Therefore, x (cid:0) α must be a factor of p(x) and so\np(x) = (x(cid:0)α)q (x), where degq (x) = degp(x)(cid:0)1. Continue this process with q (x) to\n1 1 1\nfind a factorization\np(x) = (x(cid:0)α)(x(cid:0)β)q (x),\n2\nwhere degq (x) = degp(x)(cid:0)2.

In other words, can\nwe find a field extension of F such that p(x) factors into a product of linear polynomials?\nWhat is the “smallest” extension containing all the roots of p(x)?\nLet F be a field and p(x) = a +a x+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a xn be a nonconstant polynomial in F[x].\n0 1 n\nAn extension field E of F is a splitting field of p(x) if there exist elements α ,...,α in E\n1 n\nsuch that E = F(α ,...,α ) and\n1 n\np(x) = (x(cid:0)α )(x(cid:0)α )(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(x(cid:0)α ).\n1 2 n\nA polynomial p(x) 2 F[x] splits in E if it is the product of linear factors in E[x].\nExample 21.29 Let p(x) = x4 + 2x2 (cid:0) p8 be in Q[x]. Then p(x) has irreducible factors\nx2(cid:0)2 and x2+4. Therefore, the field Q( 2,i) is a splitting field for p(x). □\np\nExample 21.30 Let p(x) = x3 (cid:0)3 be in Q[x]. Then p(x) has a root in the field Q( 3 3).\nHowever, this field is not a splitting field for p(x) since the complex cube roots of 3,\np p\n(cid:0) 3 3(cid:6)( 6 3)5i\n,\n2\np\nare not in Q( 3 3). □\nTheorem 21.31 Let p(x) 2 F[x] be a nonconstant polynomial. Then there exists a splitting\nfield E for p(x).\nProof. We will use mathematical induction on the degree of p(x). If degp(x) = 1, then\np(x) is a linear polynomial and E = F. Assume that the theorem is true for all polynomials\nof degree k with 1 (cid:20) k < n and let degp(x) = n. We can assume that p(x) is irreducible;\notherwise, by our induction hypothesis, we are done. By Theorem 21.5, there exists a field\nK such that p(x) has a zero α in K. Hence, p(x) = (x (cid:0) α )q(x), where q(x) 2 K[x].\n1 1\nSince degq(x) = n(cid:0)1, there exists a splitting field E (cid:27) K of q(x) that contains the zeros\nα ,...,α of p(x) by our induction hypothesis.

Given two splitting fields K and L of a polynomial p(x) 2 F[x], there exists\na field isomorphism ϕ : K ! L that preserves F. In order to prove this result, we must first\nprove a lemma.\nLemma 21.32 Let ϕ : E ! F be an isomorphism of fields. Let K be an extension field\nof E and α 2 K be algebraic over E with minimal polynomial p(x). Suppose that L is\nan extension field of F such that β is root of the polynomial in F[x] obtained from p(x)\nunder the image of ϕ. Then ϕ extends to a unique isomorphism ϕ : E(α) ! F(β) such that\nϕ(α) = β and ϕ agrees with ϕ on E.\nProof. If p(x) has degree n, then by Theorem 21.13 we can write any element in E(α)\nas a linear combination of\n1,α,...,αn−1.\nTherefore, the isomorphism that we are seeking\nmust be\nϕ(a 0+a 1α+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a n−1αn−1) = ϕ(a 0)+ϕ(a 1)β+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+ϕ(a n−1)βn−1,\nwhere\na 0+a 1α+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a n−1αn−1\nis an element in E(α). The fact that ϕ is an isomorphism could be checked by direct\ncomputation; however, it is easier to observe that ϕ is a composition of maps that we\nalready know to be isomorphisms.\nWe can extend ϕ to be an isomorphism from E[x] to F[x], which we will also denote by\nϕ, by letting\nϕ(a +a x+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a xn) = ϕ(a )+ϕ(a )x+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+ϕ(a )xn.\n0 1 n 0 1 n\nThis extension agrees with the original isomorphism ϕ : E !

These problems are geometric in\nnature and involve straightedge-and-compass constructions from what is now high school\ngeometry; that is, we are allowed to use only a straightedge and compass to solve them.\nThe problems can be stated as follows.\n1. Given an arbitrary angle, can one trisect the angle into three equal subangles using\nonly a straightedge and compass?\n2. Given an arbitrary circle, can one construct a square with the same area using only a\nstraightedge and compass?\n3. Given a cube, can one construct the edge of another cube having twice the volume of\nthe original? Again, we are only allowed to use a straightedge and compass to do the\nconstruction.\nAfter puzzling mathematicians for over two thousand years, each of these constructions was\nfinally shown to be impossible. We will use the theory of fields to provide a proof that the\nsolutions do not exist. It is quite remarkable that the long-sought solution to each of these\nthree geometric problems came from abstract algebra.\nFirst, let us determine more specifically what we mean by a straightedge and compass,\nand also examine the nature of these problems in a bit more depth. To begin with, a\nstraightedge is not a ruler. We cannot measure arbitrary lengths with a straightedge. It is\nmerely a tool for drawing a line through two points. The statement that the trisection of\nan arbitrary angle is impossible means that there is at least one angle that is impossible to\ntrisect with a straightedge-and-compass construction. Certainly it is possible to trisect an\n◦ ◦\nangle in special cases. We can construct a 30 angle; hence, it is possible to trisect a 90"

Therefore, we\n◦\ncannot trisect a 60 angle.\nConstructible Numbers\nA real number α is constructible if we can construct a line segment of length jαj in a finite\nnumber of steps from a segment of unit length by using a straightedge and compass.\nTheorem 21.37 The set of all constructible real numbers forms a subfield F of the field of\nreal numbers.\nProof. Let α and β be constructible numbers. We must show that α+β, α(cid:0)β, αβ, and\nα/β (β 6= 0) are also constructible numbers. We can assume that both α and β are positive\nwith α > β. It is quite obvious how to construct α+β and α(cid:0)β. To find a line segment\nwith length αβ, we assume that β > 1 and construct the triangle in Figure 21.38 such that\ntriangles 4ABC and 4ADE are similar. Since α/1 = x/β, the line segment x has length\nαβ. A similar construction can be made if β < 1.

In this chapter we will show\np\nthat a unique finite field of order pn exists for every prime p, where n is a positive integer.\nFinite fields are also called Galois fields in honor of Évariste Galois, who was one of the first\nmathematicians to investigate them.\n22.1 Structure of a Finite Field\nRecall that a field F has characteristic p if p is the smallest positive integer such that for\nevery nonzero element α in F, we have pα = 0. If no such integer exists, then F has\ncharacteristic 0. From Theorem 16.19 we know that p must be prime. Suppose that F is a\nfinite field with n elements. Then nα = 0 for all α in F. Consequently, the characteristic of\nF must be p, where p is a prime dividing n. This discussion is summarized in the following\nproposition.\nProposition 22.1 If F is a finite field, then the characteristic of F is p, where p is prime.\nThroughout this chapter we will assume that p is a prime number unless otherwise\nstated.\nProposition 22.2 If F is a finite field of characteristic p, then the order of F is pn for\nsome n 2 N.\nProof. Let ϕ : Z ! F be the ring homomorphism defined by ϕ(n) = n (cid:1) 1. Since the\ncharacteristic of F is p, the kernel of ϕ must be pZ and the image of ϕ must be a subfield\nof F isomorphic to Z . We will denote this subfield by K. Since F is a finite field, it\np\nmust be a finite extension of K and, therefore, an algebraic extension of K. Suppose that\n[F : K] = n is the dimension of F, where F is a K vector space. There must exist elements\nα ,...,α 2 F such that any element α in F can be written uniquely in the form\n1 n\nα = a α +(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a α ,\n1 1 n n\nwhere the a ’s are in K. Since there are p elements in K, there are pn possible linear\ni\ncombinations of the α ’s. Therefore, the order of F must be pn. ■\ni\nLemma 22.3 Freshman’s Dream.

Furthermore, any field of order pn is isomorphic to the splitting field of\nxpn (cid:0)x over Z .\np\nProof. Let f(x) = xpn (cid:0)x and let F be the splitting field of f(x). Then by Lemma 22.5,\nf(x) has pn distinct zeros in F, since f′ (x) = pnxpn−1 (cid:0) 1 = (cid:0)1 is relatively prime to\nf(x). We claim that the roots of f(x) form a subfield of F. Certainly 0 and 1 are zeros\nof f(x). If α and β are zeros of f(x), then α + β and αβ are also zeros of f(x), since\nαpn+βpn = (α+β)pn and αpnβpn = (αβ)pn. We also need to show that the additive inverse\nand the multiplicative inverse of each root of f(x) are roots of f(x). For any zero α of f(x),\nwe know that (cid:0)α is also a zero of f(x), since\nf((cid:0)α) = ((cid:0)α)pn (cid:0)((cid:0)α) = (cid:0)αpn +α = (cid:0)(αpn (cid:0)α) = 0,\nprovided p is odd. If p = 2, then\nf((cid:0)α) = ((cid:0)α)2n (cid:0)((cid:0)α) = α+α = 0.\nIf α 6= 0, then (α−1)pn = (αpn)−1 = α−1. Since the zeros of f(x) form a subfield of F and\nf(x) splits in this subfield, the subfield must be all of F.\nLet E be any other field of order pn. To show that E is isomorphic to F, we must show\nthat every element in E is a root of f(x). Certainly 0 is a root of f(x). Let α be a nonzero\nelement of E. The order of the multiplicative group of nonzero elements of E is pn (cid:0) 1;\nhence, αpn−1 = 1 or αpn (cid:0)α = 0. Since E contains pn elements, E must be a splitting field\nof f(x); however, by Corollary 21.36, the splitting field of any polynomial is unique up to\nisomorphism. ■\nThe unique finite field with pn elements is called the Galois field of order pn. We will\ndenote this field by GF(pn).\nTheorem 22.7 Every subfield of the Galois field GF(pn) has pm elements, where m divides\nn. Conversely, if m j n for m > 0, then there exists a unique subfield of GF(pn) isomorphic\nto GF(pm).\nProof. Let F be a subfield of E = GF(pn). Then F must be a field extension of K that\ncontains pm elements, where K is isomorphic to Z . Then m j n, since [E : K] = [E : F][F :\np\nK].\nTo prove the converse, suppose that m j n for some m > 0. Then pm(cid:0)1 divides pn(cid:0)1.\nConsequently, xpm−1 (cid:0)1 divides xpn−1 (cid:0)1. Therefore, xpm (cid:0)x must divide xpn (cid:0)x, and\nevery zero of xpm (cid:0) x is also a zero of xpn (cid:0) x. Thus, GF(pn) contains, as a subfield, a\nsplitting field of xpm (cid:0)x, which must be isomorphic to GF(pm). ■\nExample 22.8 The lattice of subfields of GF(p24) is given in Figure 22.9. □"

First let us recall that an (n,k)-block code\nconsists of a one-to-one encoding function E : Zk ! Zn and a decoding function D : Zn !\n2 2 2\nZk. The code is error-correcting if D is onto. A code is a linear code if it is the null space\n2\nof a matrix H 2 M k×n(Z 2).\nWe are interested in a class of codes known as cyclic codes. Let ϕ : Zk ! Zn be a binary\n2 2\n(n,k)-blockcode. Thenϕisacycliccode ifforeverycodeword(a ,a ,...,a ),thecyclically\n1 2 n\nshifted n-tuple (a n,a 1,a 2,...,a n−1) is also a codeword. Cyclic codes are particularly easy\nto implement on a computer using shift registers [2, 3].\nExample 22.14 Consider the (6,3)-linear codes generated by the two matrices\n0 1 0 1\n1 0 0 1 0 0\nB C B C\nB0 1 0C B1 1 0C\nB C B C\nB0 0 1C B1 1 1C\nG = B C and G = B C.\n1 B1 0 0C 2 B1 1 1C\nB C B C\n@ A @ A\n0 1 0 0 1 1\n0 0 1 0 0 1\nMessages in the first code are encoded as follows:\n(000) 7! (000000) (100) 7! (100100)\n(001) 7! (001001) (101) 7! (101101)\n(010) 7! (010010) (110) 7! (110110)\n(011) 7! (011011) (111) 7! (111111).\nIt is easy to see that the codewords form a cyclic code. In the second code, 3-tuples are\nencoded in the following manner:\n(000) 7! (000000) (100) 7! (111100)\n(001) 7! (001111) (101) 7! (110011)\n(010) 7! (011110) (110) 7! (100010)\n(011) 7! (010001) (111) 7! (101101).\nThis code cannot be cyclic, since (101101) is a codeword but (011011) is not a codeword.\n□\nPolynomial Codes\nWewouldliketofindaneasymethodofobtainingcycliclinearcodes. Toaccomplishthis,we\ncan use our knowledge of finite fields and polynomial rings over Z . Any binary n-tuple can\n2\nbe interpreted as a polynomial in Z 2[x]. Stated another way, the n-tuple (a 0,a 1,...,a n−1)\ncorresponds to the polynomial\nf(x) = a 0+a 1x+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a n−1xn−1,"

For example, the polynomial corresponding to\nthe 5-tuple (10011) is\n1+0x+0x2+1x3+1x4 = 1+x3+x4.\nConversely, with any polynomial f(x) 2 Z [x] with degf(x) < n we can associate a binary\n2\nn-tuple. The polynomial x+x2+x4 corresponds to the 5-tuple (01101).\nLet us fix a nonconstant polynomial g(x) in Z [x] of degree n(cid:0)k. We can define an\n2\n(n,k)-code C in the following manner. If (a 0,...,a k−1) is a k-tuple to be encoded, then\nf(x) = a 0+a 1x+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a k−1xk−1 is the corresponding polynomial in Z 2[x]. To encode f(x),\nwe multiply by g(x). The codewords in C are all those polynomials in Z [x] of degree less\n2\nthan n that are divisible by g(x). Codes obtained in this manner are called polynomial\ncodes.\nExample 22.15 If we let g(x) = 1+x3, we can define a (6,3)-code C as follows. To encode\na 3-tuple (a ,a ,a ), we multiply the corresponding polynomial f(x) = a +a x+a x2 by\n0 1 2 0 1 2\n1+x3. We are defining a map ϕ : Z3 ! Z6 by ϕ : f(x) 7! g(x)f(x). It is easy to check that\n2 2\nthis map is a group homomorphism. In fact, if we regard Zn as a vector space over Z , ϕ is\n2 2\na linear transformation of vector spaces (see Exercise 20.5.15, Chapter 20). Let us compute\nthe kernel of ϕ. Observe that ϕ(a ,a ,a ) = (000000) exactly when\n0 1 2\n0+0x+0x2+0x3+0x4+0x5 = (1+x3)(a +a x+a x2)\n0 1 2\n= a +a x+a x2+a x3+a x4+a x5.\n0 1 2 0 1 2\nSince the polynomials over a field form an integral domain, a +a x+a x2 must be the\n0 1 2\nzero polynomial. Therefore, kerϕ = f(000)g and ϕ is one-to-one.\nTo calculate a generator matrix for C, we merely need to examine the way the polyno-\nmials 1, x, and x2 are encoded:\n(1+x3)(cid:1)1 = 1+x3\n(1+x3)x = x+x4\n(1+x3)x2 = x2+x5.\nWe obtain the code corresponding to the generator matrix G in Example 22.14.

Recall that xn (cid:0) 1 =\n(x(cid:0)1)(xn−1+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+x+1).\nThe factor ring\nR = Z [x]/hxn(cid:0)1i\nn 2\ncan be considered to be the ring of polynomials of the form\nf(t) = a 0+a 1t+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a n−1tn−1"

We will often identify elements in Zn with elements in Z[x]/hxn(cid:0)1i.\n2\nIn this manner we can interpret a linear code as a subset of Z[x]/hxn(cid:0)1i.\nThe additional ring structure on polynomial codes is very powerful in describing cyclic\ncodes. A cyclic shift of an n-tuple can be described by polynomial multiplication. If\nf(t) = a 0+a 1t+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a n−1tn−1 is a code polynomial in R n, then\ntf(t) = a n−1+a 0t+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+a n−2tn−1\nis the cyclically shifted word obtained from multiplying f(t) by t.

Let C be a linear cyclic code and suppose that f(t) is in C. Then tf(t) must also\nbe in C. Consequently, tkf(t) is in C for all k 2 N. Since C is a linear code, any linear\ncombination of the codewords\nf(t),tf(t),t2f(t),...,tn−1f(t)\nis also a codeword; therefore,\nfor every polynomial p(t), p(t)f(t) is in C. Hence, C is an ideal.\nConversely, let C be an ideal in Z [x]/hxn +1i. Suppose that f(t) = a +a t+(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)+\n2 0 1\na\nn−1tn−1\nis a codeword in C. Then tf(t) is a codeword in C; that is, (a 1,...,a n−1,a 0) is\nin C. ■\nTheorem 22.16 tells us that knowing the ideals of R is equivalent to knowing the linear\nn\ncyclic codes in Zn. Fortunately, the ideals in R are easy to describe. The natural ring\n2 n\nhomomorphism ϕ : Z [x] ! R defined by ϕ[f(x)] = f(t) is a surjective homomorphism.\n2 n\nThe kernel of ϕ is the ideal generated by xn(cid:0)1. By Theorem 16.34, every ideal C in R is\nn\nof the form ϕ(I), where I is an ideal in Z [x] that contains hxn(cid:0)1i. By Theorem 17.20, we\n2\nknowthateveryidealI inZ [x]isaprincipalideal, sinceZ isafield. Therefore, I = hg(x)i\n2 2\nfor some unique monic polynomial in Z [x]. Since hxn(cid:0)1i is contained in I, it must be the\n2\ncase that g(x) divides xn(cid:0)1. Consequently, every ideal C in R is of the form\nn\nC = hg(t)i = ff(t)g(t) : f(t) 2 R and g(x) j (xn(cid:0)1) in Z [x]g.\nn 2\nThe unique monic polynomial of the smallest degree that generates C is called the minimal\ngenerator polynomial of C.\nExample 22.17 If we factor x7(cid:0)1 into irreducible components, we have\nx7(cid:0)1 = (1+x)(1+x+x3)(1+x2+x3).\nWe see that g(t) = (1+t+t3) generates an ideal C in R . This code is a (7,4)-block code.\n7\nAs in Example 22.15, it is easy to calculate a generator matrix by examining what g(t) does\nto the polynomials 1, t, t2, and t3.

        "content": "23\nGalois Theory\nA classic problem of algebra is to find the solutions of a polynomial equation. The solution\nto the quadratic equation was known in antiquity. Italian mathematicians found general\nsolutions to the general cubic and quartic equations in the sixteenth century; however,\nattempts to solve the general fifth-degree, or quintic, polynomial were repulsed for the next\nthree hundred years. Certainly, equations such as x5 (cid:0)1 = 0 or x6 (cid:0)x3 (cid:0)6 = 0 could be\nsolved, but no solution like the quadratic formula was found for the general quintic,\nax5+bx4+cx3+dx2+ex+f = 0.\nFinally, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Ruﬀini and Abel both found quintics\nthat could not be solved with any formula. It was Galois, however, who provided the full\nexplanation by showing which polynomials could and could not be solved by formulas. He\ndiscovered the connection between groups and field extensions. Galois theory demonstrates\nthe strong interdependence of group and field theory, and has had far-reaching implications\nbeyond its original purpose.\nIn this chapter we will prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. This result\nwill be used to establish the insolvability of the quintic and to prove the Fundamental\nTheorem of Algebra.\n23.1 Field Automorphisms\nOur first task is to establish a link between group theory and field theory by examining\nautomorphisms of fields.\nProposition 23.1 The set of all automorphisms of a field F is a group under composition\nof functions.\nProof. If σ and τ are automorphisms of F, then so are στ and\nσ−1.\nThe identity is\ncertainly an automorphism; hence, the set of all automorphisms of a field F is indeed a\ngroup. ■\nProposition 23.2 Let E be a field extension of F. Then the set of all automorphisms of\nE that fix F elementwise is a group; that is, the set of all automorphisms σ : E ! E such\nthat σ(α) = α for all α 2 F is a group.\nProof.

First assume that charF = 0. Since degf (x) < degf(x) and f(x) is irreducible,\nthe only way gcd(f(x),f′ (x)) 6= 1 is if f′ (x) is the zero polynomial; however, this is impos-\n′\nsible in a field of characteristic zero.

Hence, h(x) and g(x) have a single\nj\ncommon factor in F(γ)[x]; that is, the minimal polynomial of β over F(γ) must be linear,\nsince β is the only zero common to both g(x) and h(x).

Our goal is to arrive at criteria that will tell\nus whether or not a polynomial f(x) is solvable by radicals by examining the Galois group\nf(x).\nThe easiest polynomial to solve by radicals is one of the form xn (cid:0)a. As we discussed\nin Chapter 4, the roots of xn(cid:0)1 are called the nth roots of unity. These roots are a finite\nsubgroup of the splitting field of xn(cid:0)1.

This theorem was first proven by Gauss in his doctoral thesis. Prior\ntoGauss’sproof,mathematicianssuspectedthattheremightexistpolynomialsoverthereal\nand complex numbers having no solutions. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states\nthat every polynomial over the complex numbers factors into distinct linear factors.\nTheorem 23.34 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. The field of complex numbers is\nalgebraically closed; that is, every polynomial in C[x] has a root in C.\nProof. Suppose that E is a proper finite field extension of the complex numbers. Since\nany finite extension of a field of characteristic zero is a simple extension, there exists an\nα 2 E such that E = C(α) with α the root of an irreducible polynomial f(x) in C[x].

We\nmust show that it is impossible for L to be a proper extension of C.\nSupposethatLisaproperextensionofC. SinceListhesplittingfieldoff(x) = (x2+1)\nover R, L is a finite normal separable extension of R. Let K be the fixed field of a Sylow\n2-subgroup G of G(L/R). Then L (cid:27) K (cid:27) R and jG(L/K)j = [L : K]. Since [L : R] = [L :\nK][K : R], we know that [K : R] must be odd. Consequently, K = R(β) with β having a\nminimal polynomial f(x) of odd degree. Therefore, K = R.\nWe now know that G(L/R) must be a 2-group. It follows that G(L/C) is a 2-group. We\nhave assumed that L 6= C; therefore, jG(L/C)j (cid:21) 2. By the first Sylow Theorem and the\nFundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, there exists a subgroup G of G(L/C) of index 2\nand a field E fixed elementwise by G. Then [E : C] = 2 and there exists an elepment γ 2 E\nwith minimal polynomial x2+bx+c in C[x]. This polynomial has roots ((cid:0)b(cid:6) b2(cid:0)4c)/2\nthat are in C, since b2(cid:0)4c is in C. This is impossible; hence, L = C. ■\nAlthough our proof was strictly algebraic, we were forced to rely on results from cal-\nculus. It is necessary to assume the completeness axiom from analysis to show that every\npolynomial of odd degree has a real root and that every positive real number has a square\nroot. It seems that there is no possible way to avoid this diﬀiculty and formulate a purely\nalgebraic argument.

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other\nfunctional and useful document “free” in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effec-\ntive freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially\nor noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way\nto get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made\nby others.\nThis License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative works of the document\nmustthemselvesbefreeinthesamesense.

But this License is not limited to software manuals;\nit can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published\nas a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is\ninstruction or reference.\n1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS. This License applies to any manual or\nother work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying\nit can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide,\nroyalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated\nherein. The “Document”, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the\npublic is a licensee, and is addressed as “you”. You accept the license if you copy, modify\nor distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.\nA “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the Document or a\nportion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.\nA “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document\nthat deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document\nto the Document’s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could\nfall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of\nmathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship\n311"

If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not\nallowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.\nIf the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.\nThe “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover\nTexts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this\nLicense. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at\nmost 25 words.\nA “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in\na format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising\nthe document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels)\ngeneric paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is\nsuitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats\nsuitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format\nwhosemarkup,orabsenceofmarkup,hasbeenarrangedtothwartordiscouragesubsequent\nmodification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for\nany substantial amount of text. A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.\nExamplesofsuitableformatsforTransparentcopiesincludeplainASCIIwithoutmarkup,\nTexinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD,\nand standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modifica-\ntion. ExamplesoftransparentimageformatsincludePNG,XCFandJPG.Opaqueformats\ninclude proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word proces-\nsors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available,\nand the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors\nfor output purposes only.\nThe “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following\npages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title\npage. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means\nthe text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title, preceding the beginning\nof the body of the text.\nThe “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to\nthe public.\nA section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose title either\nis precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in\nanother language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such\nas “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.) To “Preserve the\nTitle” of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section\n“Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.\nThe Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that\nthis License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be\nincluded by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other\nimplication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the\nmeaning of this License.\n2.

COPYING IN QUANTITY. If you publish printed copies (or copies in media\nthat commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the\nDocument’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that\ncarry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and\nBack-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you\nas the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words\nof the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in\naddition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of\nthe Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other\nrespects.\nIf the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put\nthe first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest\nonto adjacent pages.\nIf you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100,\nyou must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy,\nor state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general\nnetwork-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a\ncomplete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter\noption, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque\ncopies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the\nstated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy\n(directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.\nIt is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well\nbefore redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with\nan updated version of the Document.\n4. MODIFICATIONS. You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Docu-\nment under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified\nVersion under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Doc-\nument, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever\npossesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\nA. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the\nDocument, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be\nlisted in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a\nprevious version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.\nB. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for\nauthorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five\nof the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer\nthan five), unless they release you from this requirement.\nC. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the\npublisher."

COMBINING DOCUMENTS. You may combine the Document with other docu-\nments released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified\nversions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of\ntheoriginaldocuments,unmodified,andlistthemallasInvariantSectionsofyourcombined\nwork in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.\nThe combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical\nInvariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant\nSections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section\nunique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or\npublisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to\nthe section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.\nIn the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History” in the various\noriginal documents, forming one section Entitled “History”; likewise combine any sections\nEntitled “Acknowledgements”, and any sections Entitled “Dedications”. You must delete\nall sections Entitled “Endorsements”.\n6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS. You may make a collection consisting of\nthe Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual\ncopies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the\ncollection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each\nof the documents in all other respects.\nYou may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually\nunder this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document,\nand follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.\n7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS. A compilation of the\nDocument or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or\non a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright\nresulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation’s users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate,\nthis License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves\nderivative works of the Document.\nIf the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document,\nthen if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover\nTexts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the\nelectronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must\nappear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.\n8. TRANSLATION. Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may\ndistribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.

You may include a translation of this License, and all\nthe license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also\ninclude the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices\nand disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version\nof this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.\nIf a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”, “Dedications”, or “His-\ntory”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require\nchanging the actual title.\n9. TERMINATION. Youmaynotcopy,modify,sublicense,ordistributetheDocument\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this\nLicense.\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular\ncopyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explic-\nitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to\nnotify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if\nthe copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first\ntime you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright\nholder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties\nwho have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been\nterminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same\nmaterial does not give you any rights to use it.\n10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE. The Free Software Foundation\nmay publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to\ntime. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns. See www.gnu.org/copyleft.\nEach version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document\nspecifies that a particular numbered version of this License “or any later version” applies\nto it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified\nversion or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software\nFoundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may\nchoose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nDocument specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be\nused, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Document.\n11. RELICENSING. “MassiveMultiauthorCollaborationSite”(or“MMCSite”)means\nany World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides promi-\nnent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an\nexample of such a server.

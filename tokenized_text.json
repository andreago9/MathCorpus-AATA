        "It\nhas been a pleasure to work with them.\n",
        "Robert Beezer encouraged me to make Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications avail-\nable as an open source textbook, a decision that I have never regretted.",
        "With his assistance,\nthe book has been rewritten in PreTeXt (pretextbook.org1), making it possible to quickly\noutput print, web, pdf versions and more from the same source.",
        "The open source version\nof this book has received support from the National Science Foundation (Awards #DUE-\n1020957, #DUE–1625223, and #DUE–1821329).\n",
        "1pretextbook.org\niv\n\nPreface\nThis text is intended for a one or two-semester undergraduate course in abstract algebra.\n",
        "Traditionally, these courses have covered the theoretical aspects of groups, rings, and fields.\n",
        "However, with the development of computing in the last several decades, applications that\ninvolve abstract algebra and discrete mathematics have become increasingly important,\nand many science, engineering, and computer science students are now electing to minor in\nmathematics.",
        "Though theory still occupies a central role in the subject of abstract algebra\nand no student should go through such a course without a good notion of what a proof is, the\nimportance of applications such as coding theory and cryptography has grown significantly.\n",
        "Until recently most abstract algebra texts included few if any applications.",
        "However,\none of the major problems in teaching an abstract algebra course is that for many students it\nis their first encounter with an environment that requires them to do rigorous proofs.",
        "Such\nstudents often find it hard to see the use of learning to prove theorems and propositions;\napplied examples help the instructor provide motivation.\n",
        "This text contains more material than can possibly be covered in a single semester.\n",
        "Certainly there is adequate material for a two-semester course, and perhaps more; however,\nfor a one-semester course it would be quite easy to omit selected chapters and still have a\nuseful text.",
        "The order of presentation of topics is standard: groups, then rings, and finally\nfields.",
        "Emphasis can be placed either on theory or on applications.",
        "A typical one-semester\ncourse might cover groups and rings while briefly touching on field theory, using Chapters 1\nthrough 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 (the first part), 16, 17, 18 (the first part), 20, and 21.",
        "Parts of\nthese chapters could be deleted and applications substituted according to the interests of\nthe students and the instructor.",
        "A two-semester course emphasizing theory might cover\nChapters 1 through 6, 9, 10, 11, 13 through 18, 20, 21, 22 (the first part), and 23.",
        "On\nthe other hand, if applications are to be emphasized, the course might cover Chapters 1\nthrough 14, and 16 through 22.",
        "In an applied course, some of the more theoretical results\ncould be assumed or omitted.",
        "A chapter dependency chart appears below.",
        "(A broken line\nindicates a partial dependency.)\nv\n\nvi\nChapters 1–6\nChapter 8\nChapter 9\nChapter 7\nChapter 10\nChapter 11\nChapter 13\nChapter 16\nChapter 12\nChapter 14\nChapter 17\nChapter 15\nChapter 18\nChapter 20\nChapter 19\nChapter 21\nChapter 22\nChapter 23\nThough there are no specific prerequisites for a course in abstract algebra, students\nwho have had other higher-level courses in mathematics will generally be more prepared\nthan those who have not, because they will possess a bit more mathematical sophistication.\n",
        "Occasionally, we shall assume some basic linear algebra; that is, we shall take for granted an\nelementary knowledge of matrices and determinants.",
        "This should present no great problem,\nsince most students taking a course in abstract algebra have been introduced to matrices\nand determinants elsewhere in their career, if they have not already taken a sophomore or\njunior-level course in linear algebra.\n",
        "Exercise sections are the heart of any mathematics text.",
        "An exercise set appears at the\nend of each chapter.",
        "The nature of the exercises ranges over several categories; computa-\ntional, conceptual, and theoretical problems are included.",
        "A section presenting hints and\nsolutions to many of the exercises appears at the end of the text.",
        "Often in the solutions\na proof is only sketched, and it is up to the student to provide the details.",
        "The exercises\nrange in diﬀiculty from very easy to very challenging.",
        "Many of the more substantial prob-\nlems require careful thought, so the student should not be discouraged if the solution is not\nforthcoming after a few minutes of work.\n",
        "Ideally, students should read the relavent material before attending class.",
        "Reading ques-\ntions have been added to each chapter before the exercises.",
        "To prepare for class, students\n\nvii\nshould read the chapter before class and then answer the section’s reading questions to\nprepare for the class.\n",
        "There are additional exercises or computer projects at the ends of many of the chapters.\n",
        "The computer projects usually require a knowledge of programming.",
        "All of these exercises\nand projects are more substantial in nature and allow the exploration of new results and\ntheory.\n",
        "Sage (sagemath.org2) is a free, open source, software system for advanced mathematics,\nwhich is ideal for assisting with a study of abstract algebra.",
        "Sage can be used either on\nyour own computer, a local server, or on CoCalc (cocalc.com3).",
        "Robert Beezer has written\na comprehensive introduction to Sage and a selection of relevant exercises that appear at\nthe end of each chapter, including live Sage cells in the web version of the book.",
        "All of the\nSage code has been subject to automated tests of accuracy, using the most recent version\navailable at this time: SageMath Version 9.6 (released 2022-05-15).\n",
